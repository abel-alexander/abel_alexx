Everyone \\nat Macquarie is accountable for their conduct, and supervisors are \\naccountable for outcomes in their businesses with independent \\noversight by the Risk Management Group.\\nIn relation to the APRA matters we noted last year, the Board has \\nworked closely with Management on a comprehensive remediation \\nplan. We believe the changes proposed under this plan will have a \\npositive impact on Macquarie Bank Limited (MBL) through improved \\nsystems, frameworks and processes for regulatory reporting and \\nprudential risk management; enhanced governance, risk culture and \\nremuneration framework; and a simplified group\\xa0structure.\\nEnvironmental, social and governance\\nThe Board and Management recognise the importance of sound \\nenvironmental, social and governance (ESG) practices as part of our \\nresponsibility to our clients, shareholders and the communities in \\nwhich we operate.\\nESG considerations guide and inform the way we conduct our \\nbusiness operations and manage risk, and it is our responsibility \\nto uphold these practices to build towards a better future.

The contribution \\nfrom Commodities inventory management and trading was also up \\nwhile Financial Markets continued to deliver strong performance. The \\ncontribution from Asset Finance also increased, largely related to the \\npartial sale of the UK Meters portfolio and increased activity across \\nits other sectors. Macquarie Capital saw significantly higher fee and \\ncommission income due to mergers and acquisitions and debt capital \\nmarkets activities.

We \\nalso joined the Net Zero Banking Alliance \\n(NZBA) in FY2022 and are working with \\nbanks worldwide to standardise the \\nindustry approach to setting targets for \\n2030 and align lending and investment \\nportfolios with net zero emissions by 2050.\\nOur own net zero plan is on track to be \\nreleased by the end of 2022, and this will \\nconfirm our commitments to exit coal \\nlending and equity by 2024 and reduce \\nthe carbon intensity of our limited oil and \\ngas equity and lending positions. We were \\npleased to join the discussions with other \\nleaders at the 26th United Nations Climate \\nChange Conference (COP26) in Glasgow in \\nNovember 2021 on working together to \\naccelerate climate action.Catalysing meaningful \\nsocial impact in our \\ncommunities\\nThe Macquarie Group Foundation plays \\na vital role in how Macquarie lives out its \\npurpose, building on our strong staff-led \\napproach to giving.\\nThe Foundation is increasing the scale \\nand impact of our grantmaking, which \\ncontinues to support social and economic \\nmobility and finding opportunities to \\npartner with Macquarie’s businesses to \\nfurther social impact.\\nFocusing on the communities where our \\npeople live and work enables a better \\nunderstanding of local needs, and helps \\nto leverage our staff time, expertise and \\nnetworks for greater impact.\\nIn support of communities and families \\nacross Ukraine, Macquarie staff and \\nbusiness groups donated a total of \\n$A3.5\\xa0million, including Foundation \\nmatching, to organisations working to \\nprovide vital humanitarian support.\\nA one-time $A20\\xa0million additional \\nallocation was also made to the Macquarie \\nGroup Foundation to expand our Social \\nImpact Investing program, which invests to \\ngenerate positive, measurable social impact \\nalongside a financial return. Macquarie also \\nannounced a first-of-its-kind initiative for \\nunemployed people in the UK, the Green \\nJobs program, with catalytic funding \\nprovided by the Foundation.Embedding ESG \\nconsiderations across \\nbusiness decisions\\nWe recognise that a robust approach \\nto ESG considerations is beneficial to all \\nour stakeholders, and is integral to our \\ncommitment to investing for a better \\nfuture. ESG considerations are embedded \\nin both our operational and investment \\ndecision-making, along with the asset \\nmanagement frameworks that inform \\nhow our portfolio companies assess and \\nimprove their performance.\\nThe delivery of sustainable long-term \\nvalue requires the allocation of capital \\nand resources in a way that identifies \\nand addresses unmet community need. \\nFinancial institutions play an essential role \\nin taking risks to support communities \\nand economic growth. For Macquarie, the \\nappetite for such risk sits within a clear risk \\nmanagement framework which has enabled \\nus to invest successfully across broad \\nareas of sustainable development over \\nmany decades. \\nMeanwhile, well-considered corporate \\ngovernance is essential in promoting \\ntransparency and accountability and \\ncreating an environment of trust. Evolving \\ngovernance expectations required of \\nboards and companies are lifting the \\nstandards to which business must perform, \\nand we strongly support this trajectory. \\nNonetheless, such obligations must also \\nbalance the ability to take necessary risks \\nto achieve sound community outcomes and \\nfinancial returns for investors. Macquarie’s \\nBoard and Management continue to devote \\nsignificant time to ensuring we achieve this \\nbalance across our business activities. For two decades we’ve used our deep capabilities in \\nagriculture, energy, infrastructure, transportation, \\ntechnology and commodities to work with clients and \\nour portfolio businesses to create practical solutions to \\ntheir decarbonisation challenges.”\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The \\nway we fulfil Macquarie’s purpose is defined by our principles \\nof What We Stand For : Opportunity, Accountability and \\nIntegrity. Staff are made aware that these principles must \\nform the basis of all behaviours and actions. These behavioural \\nexpectations are specified in the Board approved Code of \\nConduct , which is actively promoted by Management and \\ncascaded through the organisation\\n• leading and executing: Management implements behavioural \\nexpectations through leadership actions and communication, \\norganisational governance, incentives and consequence \\nmanagement and organisational and individual capability\\n• monitoring, measuring and reporting: Macquarie monitors \\nand measures its risk culture to gauge effectiveness while \\npromoting continuous improvement.\\nRisk management framework\\nMacquarie’s risk management framework is embedded across all \\noperations. The framework is the totality of systems, structures, \\npolicies, processes and people within Macquarie that identify, \\nmeasure, monitor, report and control or mitigate internal or \\nexternal sources of material risk.\\nMacquarie’s approach to risk management is based on stable and \\nrobust core risk management principles. These are:\\n• ownership of risk at the business level\\n• understanding worst-case outcomes\\n• requirement for an independent sign-off by RMG.\\nDuring the year, Macquarie detected unauthorised trading activity \\nby one individual in CGM and reported the issue promptly to all \\nrelevant regulators. While there have been no systemic issues \\nidentified and the impact is not material to CGM or MGL from a \\nP&L perspective, there are learnings from the situation in relation \\nto processes and enhancements to the control framework have \\nbeen implemented. There were no client impacts from this issue.\\nRefer to Risk Management  in section\\xa02 for details on \\nMacquarie’s risk management framework, risk culture and \\nconduct risk managementMacroeconomic and other factors\\nThe key macroeconomic risks to Macquarie’s \\nshort and medium term financial outlook noted \\non\\xa0page\\xa028 are:\\nMarket conditions\\nThe general condition of markets, driven by both macroeconomic \\nand geopolitical factors may have a bearing on Macquarie’s \\nbusinesses. Changing market conditions influence the volume and \\ntiming of client and principal transactions across businesses and \\nthe value of various equity, credit and market risk exposures held \\nby Macquarie on its balance sheet.\\nThe value of the Australian dollar\\nA significant proportion of Macquarie’s net income is \\ndenominated in foreign currency. Therefore, net income will \\nbe lower in Australian dollar terms if the Australian dollar \\nappreciates against other foreign currencies, and net income \\nwill be higher in Australian dollar terms if the Australian dollar \\ndepreciates against other foreign currencies.\\nPotential regulatory changes\\nMacquarie is affected by changes in regulation. Regulatory change \\ncontinues to increase at both the global and Australian levels \\nand has the potential to affect the regulatory capital and funding \\nrequirements and profitability of Macquarie’s businesses.\\nFunding and liquidity\\nMacquarie uses deposits and debt markets, among other funding \\nsources, to fund its assets.

This enhanced \\nperiodic review strengthens the governance framework for the \\nexternal auditor and helps manage risks relating to the auditor’s \\nindependence and effectiveness, which may include the risk of \\ninstitutional familiarity arising from the external auditor’s tenure. \\nA written report summarising the results of the annual and \\ncomprehensive (as applicable) review and feedback from the Board \\nand senior stakeholders across Macquarie finance and business \\nteams, is presented to, and discussed at, a BAC meeting and \\nseparately discussed with PwC.\\nBased on the results of this year’s annual performance and \\nindependence reviews, in May 2022 the BAC recommended to the \\nBoard that PwC continue in its role as Macquarie’s external auditor.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Meeting \\nthe goals set out in the Paris Agreement requires the private and public sectors to work \\ntogether to deliver the transition to a low -carbon future at unprecedented scale and pace, \\nand in a socially inclusive manner. Macquarie is committed to playing a leading role in driving \\nthis global transition to net zero.\\nFor two decades, we have used our deep capabilities in energy, \\ninfrastructure, transportation, technology, agriculture and \\ncommodities to work with clients to deliver practical climate \\nsolutions. Our approach to driving climate action is founded \\non\\xa0five\\xa0key areas.\\nDeveloping and investing in green energy\\nInvesting and deploying green energy is at the core of our \\ncontribution to the net zero transition. Macquarie is committed \\nto growing renewable energy capacity and is already developing, \\nconstructing, operating and financing over 50 GW of green energy \\nprojects around the world.\\nOur Green Investment Group (GIG) has more than 250 green energy \\nprojects in development or construction (either directly or through \\noperating platforms) totalling over 30 GW of predominantly \\nsolar and wind projects. FY2022 was a landmark year, as GIG \\nfurther established capabilities in the development of new clean \\ntechnologies like floating offshore wind, utility scale storage and \\nhydrogen, all of which will play a critical role in enabling deep \\ndecarbonisation.\\nOverall, Macquarie has invested and arranged $A2.3\\xa0billion into \\ngreen energy projects in the past five years alone. While some of \\nthe investments are no longer on our balance sheet they continue \\nto generate green energy every year, and will continue to do so well \\ninto the future.\\nCreating climate resilient infrastructure\\nAs the world’s largest infrastructure manager and a major developer \\nof new greenfield infrastructure, our focus on climate resilience and \\nadaptation is helping prepare communities for a changing world.\\nWith over 160 portfolio companies, 530 properties and \\n4.7\\xa0million hectares of farmland in its global portfolio, Macquarie \\nAsset Management (MAM) is investing in climate-specific \\nrisk assessments, revised operating procedures, physical \\nenhancements, industrial technologies, and training, all of which \\ncontribute to greater climate resilience.\\nMacquarie Capital is also designing climate resilience into new \\ninfrastructure projects from the start, to deal with a higher \\nfrequency of extreme weather events and rising sea levels.Enabling the decarbonisation of our customers, \\nclients and portfolio companies\\nThere is broad societal consensus on the need to decarbonise, \\nthe goals that the world needs to reach, and the steps needed to \\nget there. As a result, we are increasing our efforts, working with \\nour customers, clients and portfolio companies to help them take \\naction to decarbonise their activities. Macquarie is committed \\nto continued expansion of our capabilities to help clients and \\ncustomers navigate the transition to net zero. Building on our track \\nrecord in renewables financial advisory and in helping businesses \\nprocure clean energy for their operations, we have developed \\nfinancing and risk management solutions in areas including \\nbatteries, renewable fuels and clean transportation, and built a \\ndedicated team that helps companies enhance their sustainability \\ncommitments with carbon offsets.\\nAligning our activities to net zero\\nIn 2021, Macquarie made a commitment to align its business \\noperations and financing activities with the objective of enabling \\nand accelerating the world’s pathway to net zero by 2050.\\nLast year, we established a dedicated cross -group Net Zero Program \\nteam to assess our lending and equity clients’ existing climate \\nfootprint, and we are on track to release our first net zero plan \\nby the end of 2022. Granular analysis of our exposures within the \\noil, gas and coal sectors is well progressed. Our initial work has \\nhighlighted significant data challenges, with many clients unable to \\nprovide estimates of their emissions. Given the gaps, and to ensure \\nappropriate quality, we are augmenting our analysis with estimates \\nusing industry standards such as the Partnership for Carbon \\nAccounting Financials to guide our approach.\\nWe recognise that the availability and robustness of emissions \\ndata continues to evolve and have sought to establish approaches \\nthat can be adjusted over time as more companies compile and \\nreport their emissions footprint. We welcome moves by regulators \\nto increase transparency with regard to company level emissions. \\nThese initiatives are likely to see data availability and quality \\nimprove materially in coming years. \\nDetailed analysis is also underway to assess the emissions \\nassociated with our retail vehicle lending portfolio, focused on the \\nvehicle make, model and estimated distance travelled.\\nOver the coming months, we will continue to evolve this in -depth \\nanalysis to support the establishment of interim and long -term \\nscience -based goals for these sectors. This is in addition to \\nour existing commitment on coal, where we expect our limited \\nremaining equity and lending exposures to run off by 2024.

As highlighted in the \\ntext, FY2022 Scope 3 emissions are not comparable to previous periods due to a change in methodology.Macquarie’s direct environmental and social impacts predominantly relate to the resources \\nwe consume in our offices, data centres, business travel, and our procurement activity. \\nWe seek to manage these impacts by monitoring and reducing resource use, maintaining \\ninnovative and sustainable workplaces, maintaining carbon neutrality, and improving the \\nsustainability of our supply chain.\\nMacquarie’s 2025 Sustainability Plan articulates our corporate \\nsustainability commitments with specific and measurable targets \\nacross environmental and social pillars. In FY2022, the Plan was \\nupdated in line with current technical guidance, industry trends and \\nMacquarie’s ambition to achieve Net Zero emissions.\\nEmissions from energy use and business travel\\nMacquarie’s FY2022 absolute emissions decreased by 38% \\nfrom FY2021.(22)\\nLast year, Macquarie committed to reaching net zero operational \\nemissions by 2025.(23) This was supported by existing targets to \\nreduce electricity use and meet all of our operational electricity \\nneeds from renewable sources.\\nThis year, Macquarie has sourced the equivalent of 100% of \\nour electricity consumption from renewable sources through a \\ncombination of green tariffs (43%) and energy attribute certificates \\n(57%).(24) Due to a lack of availability, we were unable to source \\nrenewable energy certificates within the South Korean market, \\nwhich is a requirement of the RE100 market boundary criteria. \\nAll\\xa0other renewable energy purchases were sourced in line with the \\ncriteria and we are 98.4% compliant at this time. We will continue \\nto work towards full RE100 compliance by FY2023, ahead of our \\nFY2025 commitment. Our FY2022 electricity consumption was \\n40,996 MWh, which is a decrease of 5% from the previous year due \\nto premises upgrades and our cloud transformation strategy that \\nenables rationalisation of servers.\\nMacquarie has expanded its definition of Scope 3 emissions relating \\nto business travel to include air travel, ground transportation, hotelsand food and beverages.(25) Additionally, the air travel emission \\ncalculation methodology has matured to be more comprehensive \\nand now reflects the class of ticket flown (for example\\xa0economy, \\nbusiness class).\\nBusiness travel emissions continue to be affected due to ongoing \\ntravel restrictions in place since March 2020. In FY2022, we \\ncontinued to adopt virtual collaboration and conference tools to \\nsupport effective working from home and to help reduce the need \\nfor business travel.\\nIn FY2022, we initiated a review of the additional Scope 3 categories \\nof emissions resulting from upstream operational activities.(26) We \\nwill assess the materiality of the emissions from each activity and \\nestablish data strategies and calculation methodologies to support \\nbaselining and prioritisation of reduction efforts. \\nScope 1 emissions are not considered to be material, comprising \\n2.5% of Macquarie’s total operational emissions.\\nCarbon neutrality\\nSince 2010, Macquarie has maintained our carbon neutral \\ncommitment by working to reduce and offset emissions.(27) \\nIn\\xa0FY2022, to meet this commitment, Macquarie purchased \\nand\\xa0retired a portfolio of Australian Carbon Credit Units and other \\nvoluntary carbon offsets that meet the Verified Carbon Standard. \\nThe projects were selected based on quality and verifiable emissions \\nreductions.

The Standards were used this year to \\nestablish promotion criteria for all director -level staff, following last \\nyear’s successful pilot for Executive Director promotions. Further, \\nas part of broader succession planning efforts, the Executive \\nCommittee have all undertaken personal development planning \\naligned to, and grounded in, the Macquarie Leadership Standards. \\nThe Standards also underpin the design of the new Director \\nLeadership Program (DLP). This program was designed and built \\nfor Macquarie’s Associate and Division Directors globally, and the \\nlearning outcomes are mapped to each of the standards. DLP was \\npiloted in FY2022 with 23 Associate Directors from ANZ. The pilot \\nreceived favourable feedback, delivering on its objective to build \\nleadership capability, and will now scale and launch globally.

The Board is committed \\nto oversight of Macquarie’s performance, risk management, \\nengagement with regulators and culture and to promoting the \\ncreation of enduring value by realising opportunities for the benefit \\nof our clients, community, shareholders and our people.

These management representations support the \\nsign-off of the half-year and the full-year financial\\xa0statements.\\nThree lines of defence \\nMacquarie’s approach to risk management adopts the ‘three \\nlines of defence’ model which sets risk ownership responsibilities \\nfunctionally independent from oversight and assurance:\\n• primary responsibility for risk management lies with the \\nbusiness. The risk owner is the first line of defence. An\\xa0important \\npart of the role of all staff throughout Macquarie is to ensure \\nthey manage risks appropriately\\n• the Risk Management Group (RMG) forms the second line \\nof\\xa0defence and provides independent and objective review and \\nchallenge, oversight, monitoring and reporting in relation to \\nMacquarie’s material risks\\n• Internal Audit, as the third line, provides independent \\nand objective risk-based assurance on the compliance \\nwith, and effectiveness of, Macquarie’s financial and risk \\nmanagement\\xa0framework.Risk management framework\\nOverview\\nMacquarie’s risk management framework is the totality of systems, \\nstructures, policies, processes and people within Macquarie that \\nidentify, measure, monitor, report and control or\\xa0mitigate internal \\nand external sources of material risk. Material risks are those \\nthat could have a material impact, financial or non-financial on \\nMacquarie. Macquarie’s material risks include aggregate, asset, \\nconduct, credit, environmental and social (including climate change), \\nequity, financial crime, legal, liquidity, market, operational (including \\ncyber and information security), regulatory and compliance, \\nreputational, strategic, tax, and work health and safety risks. The \\nrisk management framework applies to all Operating and Central \\nService Groups. \\nDetails about the risks we manage are available \\nat\\xa0macquarie.com/risk‑ management\\nKey components\\nCore risk management principles\\nMacquarie’s approach to risk management is based on stable and \\nrobust core risk management principles. These\\xa0are:\\n• ownership of risk at the business level: Group Heads are \\nresponsible for ownership of material risks that arise in, or \\nbecause of, the business’ operations, including identification, \\nmeasurement, control and mitigation of these risks. Before \\ntaking decisions, clear analysis of the risks is sought to ensure \\nthose taken are consistent with the risk appetite and\\xa0strategy of \\nMacquarie \\n• understanding worst ‑case outcomes: Macquarie’s risk \\nmanagement approach is based on examining the consequences \\nof worst-case outcomes and determining whether these are \\nacceptable and within Macquarie’s risk appetite. This approach \\nis adopted for all material risk types and is often achieved by \\nstress testing. Macquarie operates a number of sophisticated \\nquantitative risk management processes, but the foundation of \\nthe approach is the informed consideration of both quantitative \\nand qualitative inputs by highly experienced professionals \\n• requirement for an independent sign-off by RMG : Macquarie \\nplaces significant importance on having a strong, independent \\nrisk management function charged with signing off all material \\nrisk acceptance decisions. It\\xa0is essential that RMG has the \\ncapability to do this effectively. RMG has invested in recruiting \\nskilled professionals from a range of disciplines, including those \\nwith trading or advisory and capital markets experience. For all \\nmaterial proposals, RMG’s opinion must be sought at an early \\nstage in the decision-making process. The approval document \\nsubmitted to senior management must include independent \\ninput from RMG on\\xa0risk and\\xa0return.

RMG designs and oversees \\nthe implementation of the risk management framework. RMG is \\nstructured into specialist functional divisions, depicted below, and \\nemploys an integrated approach to risk analysis and management \\nacross risk classes. RMG’s assessment and monitoring of risks \\ninvolves a collaborative effort across the divisions to ensure a \\ndetailed analysis takes place both at the individual and aggregate \\nrisk\\xa0level.\\nRMG’s oversight of risk is based on the following five\\xa0principles:\\n• Independence : RMG is independent of Macquarie’s Operating \\nand Central Service Groups. The Head of RMG, as Macquarie’s \\nCRO, reports directly to the CEO with a\\xa0secondary reporting \\nline to the BRiC. RMG approval is\\xa0required for all material risk \\nacceptance\\xa0decisions\\n• Centralised risk management : RMG’s responsibility covers the \\nwhole of Macquarie. It assesses risks from a\\xa0Macquarie-wide \\nperspective and provides a consistent approach \\nacross Macquarie\\n• Approval of all new business activities: The Operating \\nand\\xa0Central Service Groups may not undertake new businesses or \\nactivities, offer new products, enter new markets, or undertake \\nsignificant projects without first consulting RMG. RMG reviews \\nand assesses risk and sets limits. Where appropriate, these limits \\nare approved by the Executive Committees and the Board \\n• Continuous assessment : RMG continually reviews risks to \\naccount for changes in market circumstances and developments \\nwithin Macquarie’s business \\n• Frequent monitoring and reporting : The risk profile of \\nMacquarie with respect to all material risks is monitored by \\nRMG on an ongoing basis. Centralised systems exist to allow \\nRMG to monitor financial risks daily. For the valuation of trading \\npositions and deals, daily revaluation factors are sourced, where \\npossible, from independent market sources. Reporting on all \\nmaterial risks is provided to senior management and the Board.Internal audit \\nThe Internal Audit Division, as the third line, provides independent \\nand objective risk-based assurance to the Board Audit Committee \\n(BAC), other Board Committees and senior management on the \\ncompliance with, and effectiveness of, Macquarie’s financial and \\nrisk management framework, including its governance, systems, \\nstructures, policies, processes and people for managing material \\nrisks.\\xa0The Internal\\xa0Audit Division assesses whether material risks \\nhave been properly identified by management and reported to \\nthe Board, and whether key internal controls have been properly \\ndesigned and are operating effectively and sustainably to mitigate \\nthose material\\xa0risks. \\nThe BAC has primary power of direction over the Internal Audit \\nDivision and is accountable for reviewing the effectiveness of \\nthe Internal Audit function. The Head of Internal Audit reports \\nfunctionally to the BAC and is primarily accountable to it. The Head \\nof Internal Audit has unrestricted access to the BAC and its Chair \\nand meets privately with the BAC members regularly during the \\nyear. The BAC monitors and reviews the performance, degree of \\nindependence and remuneration of the Head of Internal Audit.

The RAS states transactions must generate returns \\nproportionate to the risks. Accordingly, a risk and return analysis is \\nrequired for all\\xa0significant new deals, products and businesses. \\nThe RAS is accessible to all staff and is referred to in the Code of \\nConduct . The principles of the RAS are implemented primarily \\nthrough the following mechanisms:\\nRisk tolerances\\nRisk tolerances have been established to ensure we only accept risks \\nthat are consistent with our risk appetite. \\nFinancial risks\\nLimits translate risk appetite principles into hard constraints, being \\nthe Global Risk Limit that constrains Macquarie’s aggregate level of \\nrisk as well as granular limits for specific financial risks. \\nMacquarie sets the Global Risk Limit with reference not only to \\ncapital but also to earnings so that in a prolonged, severe downturn, \\nearnings and surplus capital are sufficient to cover losses and \\nmaintain market confidence in\\xa0Macquarie. The Global Risk Limit \\nrequires Macquarie to maintain sufficient capital above regulatory \\nminimums throughout a severe but plausible economic downturn, \\nwithout taking mitigating actions. The potential financial impact of \\na non-financial risk event is also included in the Global Risk Limit.\\nMacquarie operates under a strict principle of ‘no limits, no dealing’. \\nCompliance with granular limits is monitored by the business \\nand RMG. These granular limits are set to allow the Businesses to \\nachieve their near-term plans while promoting a reassessment of \\nthe opportunity and associated risks as the limit is approached.\\nNon-financial risks\\nMacquarie seeks high standards in addressing non-financial \\nrisks. Macquarie monitors and reports on a range of metrics for \\nnon-financial risks that provide a measure of our risk profile for \\nthese risks. \\nThese metrics provide a basis for analysis and communication of \\nrisk, for forcing explicit consideration of the risk profile, raising \\nawareness of risks and facilitating debate and actions in relation to \\npotential future risks. \\nFurther explanation on Environmental, Social and \\nGovernance (ESG) and Work Health and Safety risks in \\nparticular is set out in the ESG  section of this Annual Report.\\nPolicies\\nPolicies are key tools for ensuring that risks taken are consistent \\nwith Macquarie’s risk appetite. They are designed to influence and \\ndetermine all major decisions and actions, and all activities must \\ntake place within the boundaries they set. \\nNew product and business approval process\\nAll new businesses, new products, and significant changes to \\nexisting businesses, products, processes or systems are subject to a rigorous, interactive approval process that adheres to the \\nprinciples stated in the RAS. This results in constructive dialogue on \\nrisk\\xa0matters between RMG and the relevant business.\\nThis formal process is designed so that the proposed transaction \\nor operation can be managed. All relevant risks are reviewed to \\nensure they are identified and addressed prior to implementation. \\nThese risks are also monitored on an ongoing basis. The approvals \\nof RMG, Financial Management Group, Legal and Governance and \\nother relevant stakeholders within Macquarie are required. RMG \\nalso checks that all necessary internal approvals are obtained prior \\nto commencement. \\nStress testing\\nStress testing is an integral component of Macquarie’s risk \\nmanagement framework and a key input to the capital adequacy \\nassessment process. Stress testing incorporates enterprise-wide \\nscenario analyses in which losses and capital are driven by the \\nchosen economic parameters of a scenario. The scenarios as well as \\ntheir economic parameters are tailored to Macquarie’s\\xa0portfolio.\\nStress testing is used to validate that Macquarie’s capital targets \\nand associated triggers remain appropriate given the risk profile \\nof the portfolio. It is also used to identify areas of potential \\nconcentration in Macquarie’s portfolio, as well as being a key \\nmeasure of\\xa0aggregate risk appetite, calibrated to Macquarie’s ability \\nto withstand severe stress.\\nRisk culture \\nA sound risk culture has been integral to Macquarie’s risk \\nmanagement framework since inception. Primary responsibility \\nfor risk management in Macquarie, including risk culture, is\\xa0at the \\nbusiness level. The Board, assisted by the BRiC, is\\xa0responsible for:\\n• reviewing, endorsing and monitoring Macquarie’s approach to \\nrisk culture and conduct\\n• forming a view on Macquarie’s risk culture and the extent to \\nwhich it supports the ability of Macquarie to operate consistently \\nwithin its risk appetite.\\nMacquarie’s approach to maintaining an appropriate risk culture is \\nbased on three components: \\nSetting behavioural expectations\\nSenior Management, with oversight from the Board, set behavioural \\nexpectations. The way we fulfil Macquarie’s purpose is defined by \\nour principles of What We Stand For : Opportunity, Accountability \\nand Integrity. Staff are made aware that these principles must \\nform the basis of all behaviours and actions.

The indemnity covers the following \\nliabilities and legal costs (subject to the exclusions described \\nas follows):\\n• every liability incurred by the person in their respective\\xa0capacity \\n• all legal costs incurred in defending or resisting (or otherwise \\nin connection with) proceedings in which the person becomes \\ninvolved because of their respective\\xa0capacity\\n• legal costs incurred by the person in good faith in obtaining \\nlegal advice on issues relevant to the performance and discharge \\nof their duties as an officer of MGL and its wholly-owned \\nsubsidiaries, if that has been approved in\\xa0accordance with \\nMGL policy.\\nThis indemnity does not apply to the extent that:\\n• MGL is forbidden by law to indemnify the person against \\nthe\\xa0liability or legal costs, or\\n• an indemnity by MGL of the person against the liability or\\xa0legal \\ncosts, if given, would be made void by law.\\nMGL has also entered into a Deed of Access, Indemnity, Insurance \\nand Disclosure (as amended from time to time) (Deed)\\xa0with each of \\nthe Directors. Under the Deed, MGL agrees to, among other things:\\n• indemnify the Director upon terms broadly consistent with the \\nindemnity contained in MGL’s Constitution\\n• take out and maintain an insurance policy against liabilities \\nincurred by the Director acting as an officer of MGL or its \\nwholly-owned subsidiaries. The insurance policy must be for \\nan amount and on terms and conditions appropriate for a \\nreasonably prudent company in MGL’s position. Insurance must \\nbe maintained for seven years after the Director ceases to be a \\nDirector or until any proceedings commenced during that period \\nhave been finally resolved (including any appeal\\xa0proceedings)\\n• grant access to the Director to all relevant company papers \\n(including Board papers and other documents) for seven \\nyears after the Director ceases to be a Director or until any \\nproceedings commenced during that period have been finally \\nresolved (including any appeal proceedings).\\nIn addition, MGL made an Indemnity and Insurance Deed Poll on \\n12\\xa0September 2007 (Deed Poll). The benefit of the undertakings \\nmade by MGL under the Deed Poll have been given to each of the \\ndirectors, secretaries, persons involved in the management and \\ncertain other persons, of MGL and its wholly-owned subsidiaries \\nand other companies where the person is acting as such at the \\nspecific request of MGL and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The \\nDeed Poll provides for broadly the same indemnity and insurance \\narrangements for those persons with the benefit of the Deed Poll \\nas for the Deed described above. However, the Deed Poll does not \\nprovide for access to company documents. \\nThe indemnities and insurance arrangements provided for under \\nthe MGL Constitution, the Deed and the Deed Poll, are\\xa0broadly \\nconsistent with the corresponding indemnities and insurance arrangements provided under the MBL Constitution and deeds \\nentered into by MBL.\\nMacquarie maintains a Directors’ and Officers’ insurance policy that \\nprovides cover for each person in favour of whom such insurance \\nis required to be taken out under the Deed and the Deed Poll and \\nfor MGL in indemnifying such persons pursuant to the Deed and \\nthe Deed Poll. Relevant individuals pay the premium attributable \\nto the direct coverage under the policy and MGL pays the premium \\nattributable to the company reimbursement coverage under the \\npolicy.

Staff are rewarded based on \\ntheir performance against a range of financial and non-financial \\nconsiderations, delivering positive outcomes over the long-term for \\nour clients, shareholders, partners and communities. Nevertheless, \\nwe continue to review and adjust our approach to ensure that the \\nremuneration framework remains fit for purpose and balances the \\nevolving expectations of all our stakeholders.\\nDuring the year, the Board reviewed all structural components \\nof the remuneration framework, taking into account a range \\nof perspectives. As economies emerge from the pandemic, we \\nare seeing a highly competitive global market where businesses \\nare struggling to attract and retain key talent. This dynamic is \\ncontinuing into FY2023. Macquarie has not been immune to this \\nmarket-wide challenge, which has impacted voluntary turnover \\nlevels and our ability to fill open roles. We have also reviewed the \\nremuneration framework against the expectations of shareholders \\nand regulators, including APRA’s new Prudential Standard CPS 511 \\nRemuneration  (CPS 511).\\nFollowing a comprehensive review, the Board approved several \\nchanges to fine -tune our approach. The Board considers that \\nthe revised remuneration arrangements remain consistent with \\nour remuneration principles and longstanding approach while \\nresponding to a broad range of\\xa0expectations.\\nThe key structural changes to be implemented in a phased \\napproach include:\\n• changes to the malus framework from FY2022 which was last \\namended in 2015. The group of employees who will be subject to \\nmalus is expanded to include all Executive Directors (EDs). The \\nevents that may trigger the application of the malus provisions \\nwere also expanded and aligned to CPS 511 and the expectations \\nof other global regulators\\n• changes to the release of retained profit share on termination \\nfrom FY2023. For profit share allocations made to EDs \\nfrom FY2023, where the Board exercises its discretion to \\naccelerate vesting on termination, the six-month release point \\npost-termination will be removed. Amounts that would have \\nvested after six months will now be released after 12 months \\nand amounts that would have vested after 12 months will now \\nbe released after 24 months\\n• increases to fixed remuneration levels for FY2024. Fixed \\nremuneration will be increased for the CEO and Executive Key \\nManagement Personnel (KMP) but will remain low relative to the \\nindustry and as a proportion of total remuneration\\n• changes to profit share retention and vesting arrangements \\nfrom FY2024. From FY2024, retention rates and vesting periods \\nwill be reduced for certain senior employees. For the CEO and \\nExecutive KMP, retention rates will be reduced by up to 10% and \\nvesting periods will be shortened by two years, remaining long \\nenough to appropriately consider the time horizons of risk. Upon \\nretirement from Macquarie or redundancy, unvested retained \\nprofit share will no longer be accelerated and released over a \\ntwo-year period, but instead will continue to vest on its original \\nschedule (up to five years)  For the CEO and Executive KMP, whilst an increased proportion \\nof remuneration will vest during employment, the above changes \\nwill remove the acceleration of unvested retention and extend \\nthe release period post-termination (in the case of redundancy \\nor retirement from Macquarie). Additionally, retention rates \\nand vesting periods will meet or exceed both the minimums \\nrequired under CPS 511 and the deferral arrangements of many \\nof Macquarie’s global\\xa0comparators. \\n• changes to vesting of Performance Share Units (PSUs) from \\nFY2024. For PSUs granted from FY2024 onwards, the vesting \\nperiod will be extended by a year for the MGL CEO and the \\nMBL CEO, to reflect regulatory expectations and increase the \\nalignment to shareholders.\\nFurther detail on these changes is provided on pages 99 to 100.\\nPerformance and remuneration outcomes for \\nFY2022\\nThe Board spends considerable time each year assessing \\nperformance and determining remuneration outcomes for the \\nCEO and Executive KMP. Mindful of the external focus on overall \\nremuneration levels, and recognising the expectations and \\nperspectives of all stakeholders, the Board has considered a range \\nof factors critical to Macquarie’s ongoing success.\\nIn addition to considering the financial results of Macquarie overall \\nas well as each Operating Group, the Board continues to focus on \\nnon-financial considerations to ensure senior management are \\naccountable for their decisions, behaviours and associated risk \\nmanagement, customer and reputational consequences. \\nThe Board’s determination of remuneration outcomes for FY2022 \\nfor the CEO and Executive KMP reflect the following factors:\\n• record profits and strong financial performance while delivering \\nsound customer/client and community outcomes across all four \\nbusinesses\\n• the strong leadership of the CEO and the whole Executive \\nCommittee demonstrating both an alignment to our purpose and \\nongoing resilience to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic\\n• increased cross-collaboration across Macquarie, including \\nstrategic initiatives to reflect the evolving environment in \\nclimate solutions and energy transition\\n• continued focus on building a diverse, equitable and inclusive \\nwork environment\\n• the continued investment in technology and digitalisation\\n• role-modelling and encouragement of behaviours that support a \\nstrong risk culture \\n• focus on regulatory engagement, in particular commitment to \\nstrengthening regulatory relationships, prudential compliance \\nand governance across Macquarie\\n• progress against the APRA remediation plan to strengthen the \\nvoice of the Bank\\n• continued focus on Work Health and Safety (WHS) as a key \\npriority to reduce the risk of serious injuries and fatalities across \\nour activities.

As such, they provide an additional incentive \\nto Executive Committee members to drive company-wide performance over the long-term and beyond their business group responsibilities. \\nPSU awards are a meaningful incentive but are generally not the major element of an Executive Committee member’s total remuneration.\\nIndividual allocations are based on their role as members of the Executive Committee and their contribution to driving the collective \\nperformance of Macquarie, including their collaboration across businesses. \\nPSUs are granted in August each year, after Macquarie’s Annual General Meeting (AGM), in respect of the previous financial year. The number \\nof PSUs to be allocated is calculated by dividing the face value of the award by the price of Macquarie ordinary shares on or around the \\ndate of grant.\\nSince their introduction, PSUs have been structured as DSUs with performance hurdles. Holders have no right to dividend equivalent \\npayments. There is no exercise price for PSUs. \\nPerformance hurdles\\nThe following table summarises the key terms of PSUs and the performance hurdles for FY2022:\\nEPS CAGR hurdle ROE hurdle\\nApplication 50% of PSU award 50% of PSU award\\nPerformance measure Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in EPS over the \\nvesting period (four years)(9)Average annual ROE over the vesting period \\n(four\\xa0years)(9) relative to a reference group of global \\nfinancial institutions.(10) \\nThe reference group for awards is Bank of America \\nCorporation, Barclays PLC, Credit Suisse Group AG, \\nDeutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JP \\nMorgan Chase & Co., Laazard Ltd, Morgan Stanley \\nand UBS AG.\\nHurdle Sliding scale applies:\\n• 50% becoming exercisable at EPS CAGR of 7.5%\\n• 100% at EPS CAGR of 12%\\nFor example, if EPS CAGR was 9.75%, 75% of the \\nrelevant awards would become exercisableSliding scale applies:\\n• 50% becoming exercisable above the \\n50th\\xa0percentile\\n• 100% at the 75th percentile\\nFor example, if ROE achievement was at the 60th \\npercentile, 70% of the relevant awards would \\nbecome\\xa0exercisable\\nForfeiture • malus provisions apply\\n• the standard policy is that unvested PSUs will be forfeited upon termination\\n• in the case of retirement from Macquarie, redundancy, death, serious incapacitation, disability, serious \\nill-health or other limited exceptional circumstances, the Board or the BRC has the authority to either \\naccelerate the vesting of PSUs or to permit the PSUs to continue to vest in accordance with the original \\naward schedule and remain subject to the same performance hurdles\\n• should a change of control occur(11) the Board or the BRC has discretion to determine how unvested PSUs \\nshould be treated, having regard to factors such as the length of time elapsed in the performance period, the \\nlevel of performance to date and the circumstances of the change in\\xa0control.\\n(9) PSUs awarded prior to FY2020 vested in two equal tranches after three and four years.\\n(10) Comparator company information is presented in the same order throughout the Remuneration Report.\\n(11) Under the MEREP Plan Rules, a change in control occurs where a person acquires or ceases to hold a relevant interest in more than 30% of Macquarie ordinary shares or where the \\nBoard resolves that a person is in a position to remove one-half or more of the Non-Executive Directors.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The BRC’s review includes consideration of the most relevant \\nperformance metrics to be used as hurdles as well as the levels at which the hurdles are achieved. The international reference group used \\nfor the ROE hurdle is also reviewed to determine whether our comparators remain suitable for Macquarie’s diversified business interests and \\nglobal footprint. The BRC also considers historical and forecast market data, the views of corporate governance bodies, shareholders and \\nregulators, as well as market practice. In the FY2022 annual review, both the relative ROE and absolute EPS hurdles were considered to still be \\nappropriate for the following reasons:\\n• ROE and EPS growth drive long-term shareholder value and are appropriate as the Executive Committee can affect outcomes on both \\nmeasures. In contrast, Total Shareholder Return (TSR) is influenced by many external factors over which executives have limited control\\n• the approach is consistent with that advocated by APRA in not using TSR as a measure\\n• ROE and EPS can be substantiated using information that is disclosed in Macquarie’s annual reports\\n• a sliding scale diversifies the risk of not achieving the hurdles and provides rewards proportionate to performance for shareholders and is \\npreferable to an all-or-nothing test, which some have argued could promote excessive risk-taking\\n• the hurdles are designed to reward sustained strong performance and are relatively well-insulated from short-term fluctuations. The \\ntime frame used for PSUs should also be considered in light of the three to seven-year deferral of profit share for members of the \\nExecutive Committee\\n• the EPS targets are confirmed as rigorous when market performance is considered, with the EPS threshold hurdle exceeding the \\nperformance of most of the ASX 20, global reference group and relevant indices over time\\n• for the EPS element to fully vest, Macquarie needs to achieve at least 12% CAGR over the vesting period. Supporting the rigour of the \\nhurdle, cumulative EPS growth of 57% over four years is required to achieve full vesting\\n• the ROE vesting thresholds and sliding scale are in line with the domestic market and are particularly challenging when compared to \\ninternational practice. \\nThe charts below display Macquarie’s historical EPS and ROE PSU outcomes, highlighting that since their introduction in 2009, 55% of the EPS \\ntranches and 50% of the ROE tranches have resulted in either no vesting or partial vesting.\\nHistorical EPS tranche outcomes Historical ROE tranche outcomes\\nUse of an international reference group \\nAn international reference group recognises the extent of Macquarie’s diversification and internationalisation. As at 31\\xa0March\\xa02022, total \\ninternational income represented approximately 75% of Macquarie’s total income, with approximately 54% of Macquarie’s staff located \\noutside Australia. The BRC considers an international reference group to be appropriate on the basis\\xa0that:\\n• the international reference group is currently most representative of Macquarie’s business operations and talent pool. These firms \\nbroadly operate in the same markets and in similar business segments, and compete for the same people as Macquarie \\n• Macquarie has no comparable Australian-listed peers.\\nIn addition, the BRC considers it important to not intervene reactively to remove under-performers or over-performers in any given period. \\nAn organisation’s period of under-performance is generally followed by a period of over-performance.Full\\nvesting\\nPartial\\nvesting45%No vesting \\n50%\\n5% No vesting Full\\nvesting\\n50% 18%\\n32%Partial\\nvesting ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Our purpose and principles effectively guide our staff in balancing risk and reward \\nand making decisions that realise opportunity for the benefit of our clients, shareholders, partners and the communities in which we operate. \\nStaff are continually made aware that these principles must form the basis of all behaviours and actions. These behavioural expectations \\nare outlined in the Board approved Code of Conduct , which is actively promoted by management and cascaded through the organisation \\nthrough multiple mechanisms. Macquarie invests significant time and effort in communicating and reinforcing Macquarie’s culture through \\ncommunications from senior management, policy reminders, training, and learning and development activities. The Board is able to assess \\nMacquarie’s culture in a number of ways including through staff survey results, human capital reporting, strategy presentations, risk culture \\nreports, consequence management reports as well as through personal observation of management, and staff behaviour and actions.\\nStrong risk management is a fundamental part of everyone’s role at Macquarie. Staff understand they are rewarded not just for their \\ncontribution to financial results, but also for how those results are achieved. This includes an assessment of an individual’s approach \\nto managing risk, and their alignment to the What We Stand For principles. They understand there are potential consequences for \\nnon-compliance with the risk management framework and Macquarie’s behavioural expectations. Staff training and communications \\nemphasise the link between risk, conduct, policy breaches and consequence management outcomes, including, where appropriate, \\nadjustments to performance-based remuneration.\\nAlignment of remuneration with risk outcomes\\nThe Board considers that the effective alignment of remuneration with prudent risk-taking is fundamental to its remuneration approach. The \\nconsideration of risk is embedded throughout the entire remuneration process including through the determination of individual profit share \\nallocations, business and company-wide profit share pools as well as through the way in which remuneration is structured and delivered. \\nThe Board is aware of the increasing focus of regulators and shareholders on ensuring risk-related matters that come to light subsequent \\nto remuneration being awarded are appropriately factored into remuneration decisions. Macquarie’s retention and vesting arrangements \\nprovide a mechanism for the Board to consider risk outcomes over a long period. Furthermore, where an investigation has commenced into \\na risk or conduct-related matter that may result in forfeiture or, for senior employees, the application of malus, Macquarie may further defer \\nthe payment, vesting and/or release of profit share to allow for the investigation to be completed.

This allocation is based on performance, seniority and the extent of the individual’s \\ninvolvement with the particular fund. \\n• An individual will not receive their entitlement until Macquarie has received performance fees towards the end \\nof the fund’s life, which is typically upwards of 10 years.

This included awarding minimum profit share \\nallocations of $A0.7\\xa0million and $A2.6\\xa0million for the performance \\nyears ending 31 March 2022 and 2023, respectively.

Executive \\nDirectors are each entitled to amounts equivalent to the investment earnings (dividends/distributions and security price appreciation) \\non the underlying securities. The notional returns are calculated based on Total Shareholder Return. Where these amounts are \\npositive, they may be paid to Executive Directors and are included in these remuneration disclosures as part of ‘Earnings on prior \\nyears’ restricted profit share’. If there is a notional loss, this loss will be offset against any future notional income until the loss is \\ncompletely offset and is reported as a negative amount in the same column. These earnings reflect the investment performance \\nof the assets in which prior years’ retained amounts have been notionally invested. Their inclusion in the individual remuneration \\ndisclosures on the previous pages may, therefore, cause distortions when year-on-year remuneration trends are examined. They do \\nnot reflect remuneration review decisions made about the individual’s current year performance.\\n(3) Share-based payments:\\n(a) Equity awards including shares: This represents the current year expense for retained profit share that is invested in Macquarie \\nordinary shares under the MEREP as described on pages 103 to 104. This is recognised as an expense over the respective vesting \\nperiods, or service period if shorter, as described on pages 103 to 104 and includes amounts relating to prior years equity awards that \\nhave been previously disclosed. Equity awards in respect of FY2022 performance will be granted during FY2023; however, Macquarie \\nbegins recognising an expense for these awards (based on an initial estimate) from 1\\xa0April 2021. The expense is estimated using the \\nprice of MGL ordinary shares as at 31\\xa0March 2022 and the number of equity awards expected to vest. In the following financial year, \\nMacquarie will adjust the accumulated expense recognised for the final determination of the accounting fair value for each equity \\naward when granted and will use this validation for recognising the expense over the\\xa0remaining vesting period\\n(b) PSUs:  This represents the current year expense for PSUs that is recognised over the vesting period as described on page 105. This \\nincludes amounts relating to prior years’ PSU awards. PSU awards in respect of FY2022 will be granted during FY2023; however, \\nMacquarie begins recognising an expense for these awards (based on an initial estimate) from 1\\xa0April 2021. The expense is estimated \\nusing the price of MGL ordinary shares as at 31\\xa0March 2022 and the number of PSUs expected to vest. The estimate also incorporates \\nan interest rate to maturity of 2.91% per annum, expected vesting date of 1\\xa0July 2026, and\\xa0a dividend yield of 3.63% per annum. In \\nthe following financial year, Macquarie will adjust the accumulated expense recognised for the final determination of the accounting \\nfair value for each PSU when granted and will use this validation for recognising the expense over the remaining vesting period. \\nPerformance hurdles attached to the PSUs allow for PSUs to become exercisable upon vesting only when the relevant performance \\nhurdles are met.

The \\nnotes to the financial statements set out areas involving a higher \\ndegree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions are \\nsignificant to the consolidated Financial Report such as:\\n• determining the appropriate business model for a group of \\nfinancial assets which includes determining the level at which \\nthe business model condition is applied and whether past \\nor expected sales activity is consistent with a held to collect \\nbusiness model (Note 44(vii))• assessing whether the cash flows generated by a financial \\nasset constitute solely payments of principal and interest \\n(SPPI) may require the application of judgement, particularly \\nfor certain subordinated or non-recourse positions, and in the \\ndetermination of whether compensation for early termination \\nof\\xa0a contract is reasonable (Note 44(vii))\\n• choice of inputs, estimates and assumptions used in the \\nmeasurement of Expected Credit Loss, including the \\ndetermination of significant increase in credit risk (SICR), \\nforecasts of economic conditions and the weightings assigned \\nthereto (Note 44(xxii) and Note 13)\\n• timing and amount of impairment of interests in associates \\nand joint ventures and investment in subsidiaries, including the \\nreversal thereof (Note 44(i), Note 44(xxii), Note 14 and Note 17)\\n• timing and amount of impairment of goodwill and other \\nidentifiable intangible assets and, where applicable, the reversal \\nthereof (Note 44(xxii) and Note 16)\\n• fair value of assets and liabilities including the determination \\nof non-recurring fair values and accounting for day 1 profits \\nor losses for financial instruments (Note 44(vii), Note 44(x) \\nand Note 38)\\n• distinguishing between whether assets or a business is acquired \\nunder a business combination, particularly the determination \\nof whether a substantive process exists that, together with an \\nintegrated set of activities and assets, significantly contributes \\nto the ability to create an output (Note 44(ii))\\n• determination of significant influence over associates, joint \\ncontrol over arrangements and control over subsidiaries, \\nincluding the assessment of whether certain rights are \\nprotective or substantive in nature, whether these rights are \\nheld in the capacity as agent or principal, and whether the level \\nof involvement in an investee’s relevant activities is sufficient to \\nsignificantly affect the returns generated (Note 44(i))\\n• recoverability of tax receivables, deferred tax assets and \\nmeasurement of current and deferred tax liabilities can require \\nsignificant judgement, particularly where the recoverability of \\nsuch tax balances relies on the estimation of future taxable \\nprofits and management’s determination of the likelihood that \\nuncertain tax positions will be accepted by the relevant taxation \\nauthority (Note 44(vi), Note 4 and Note 18)\\n• recognition and measurement of certain revenue streams \\nincluding performance fees from Macquarie-managed funds and \\nother capital market investments and transactions (Note 44(iv))\\n• recognition and measurement of provisions related to actual \\nand potential claims, determination of contingent liabilities \\n(Note\\xa044(iv), Note 44(xvii) and Note 33)\\n• application of hedge accounting principles, including the \\nassessment that a forecast transaction is highly probable \\n(Note\\xa044(x) and Note 35)\\n• timing of derecognition of assets and liabilities following the \\ndisposal of an investment, including the measurement of the \\nassociated gain or loss (Note 44(i)).\\nEstimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based \\non historical experience and other factors, including reasonable \\nexpectations of future events.Notes to the financial statements \\nFor the financial year ended 31 March 2022', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Actual results in the future may \\ndiffer from those reported and it is therefore reasonably possible, \\non the basis of existing knowledge, that outcomes within the next \\nfinancial year that are different from management’s assumptions \\nand estimates could require an adjustment to the carrying amounts \\nof the reported assets and liabilities in future reporting periods.\\n(iv)\\u2008Coronavirus (COVID-19) impact\\nThe Novel Coronavirus has had significant impacts on global \\neconomies and equity, debt and commodity markets, led to several \\nchanges in the economy and resulted in several support actions \\nby financial markets, governments and regulators. The impact \\nof COVID-19 continues to evolve and, where applicable, has been \\nincorporated into the determination of the Consolidated Entity’s \\nresults of operations and measurement of its assets and liabilities \\nat the reporting date.\\nThe Consolidated Entity’s processes to determine the impact \\nof COVID-19 for these financial statements is consistent with \\nthe processes disclosed and applied in its 31 March 2021 and 30 \\nSeptember 2021 financial statements. Those processes identified \\nthat expected credit losses (Note 13) required continued judgement \\nas a result of the impact of COVID-19.\\nAs there is a higher than usual degree of uncertainty associated \\nwith these assumptions and estimates, actual outcomes may differ \\nto those forecasted which may impact the accounting estimates \\nincluded in these financial statements. Other than adjusting events \\nthat provide evidence of conditions that existed at the end of the \\nreporting period, the impact of events that arise after the reporting \\nperiod will be accounted for in future reporting periods. \\nThe Consolidated Entity drew down an additional $9.5\\xa0billion \\nfrom the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) under the Term Funding \\nFacility (TFF) during the reporting period. As at 31 March 2022, \\nthe Consolidated Entity had drawn $11.3\\xa0billion under the TFF \\nwhich is in the form of repurchase agreements, is collateralised \\nwith issued loan notes in the Consolidated Entity’s home loans’ \\nsecuritisation vehicles. The objective of the TFF is to reduce interest \\nrates for borrowers and support businesses during this period \\nthrough lending.(v)\\u2008New Australian Accounting Standards and amendments \\nto Australian Accounting Standards and interpretations that \\nare either effective in the current financial year or have been \\nearly\\xa0adopted\\nThe amendments made to existing standards that were mandatorily \\neffective or have been early adopted for the annual reporting period \\nbeginning on 1 April 2021 did not result in a material impact on \\nthis Financial Report. There were no new Australian accounting \\nstandards that were mandatorily effective or have been early \\nadopted for the Financial Report.\\n(vi)\\u2008Other developments\\nIBOR reform: Transition from inter-bank offered rates (IBOR) \\nto\\xa0alternative reference rates (ARRs) \\nIBOR interest rate benchmarks, that are used in a wide variety \\nof financial instruments such as derivatives and lending \\narrangements, are undergoing reforms. Examples of IBOR \\ninclude ‘LIBOR’ (the London Inter-bank Offered Rate), ‘EURIBOR’ \\n(the Euro Inter-bank Offered Rate), ‘CDOR’ (the Canadian dollar \\noffered rate) and ‘BBSW’\\xa0(the Australian Bank Bill Swap Rate). \\nThe nature of the reforms varies across different jurisdictions. \\nFor example, in Australia the existing IBOR benchmark (BBSW) \\nhas undergone reform and is expected to continue for the \\nforeseeable future alongside the nominated ARR for AUD \\nwhich is ‘AONIA’ (AUD Overnight Index Average). In Canada, \\nthe Canadian Alternate Reference Rate Working Group (CARR) \\nhas recommended to Refinitiv Benchmark Services UK Limited \\n(Refinitiv), the administrator of CDOR, to cease publication of all \\nof CDOR’s remaining tenors after 30 June 2024. Refinitiv is yet to \\nmake a decision on the future of CDOR but expects to make an \\nannouncement in Q2 2022.\\nAfter 31 December 2021, 24 of 35 LIBOR currency-tenor pairings \\nwere discontinued, 6 LIBOR switched to a modified calculation \\nmethodology (known as ‘synthetic’ LIBORs) and 5 USD LIBOR tenors \\nare expected to cease publication after 30 June 2023. Aside from \\nthe ongoing exceptional use of USD LIBOR, the use of LIBOR in new \\ncontracts ceased by the end of 2021.\\nIndustry working groups have worked with authorities and consulted \\nwith market participants to develop market practices that may be \\nused to transition existing LIBOR-linked contracts for derivatives, \\nloans, bonds and other financial instruments that mature beyond \\ntheir respective LIBOR cessation dates, to ARRs. Amongst the \\nissues considered were the key differences between LIBOR and \\nARRs. LIBOR are term rates which are quoted at the beginning of \\nthat period (for example, one-, three-, six-or twelve-month periods) \\nand include a component of bank credit risk. ARRs on the other \\nhand are overnight rates with little or no credit risk. To facilitate \\nthe transition of contracts from LIBOR to ARRs on an economically \\nequivalent basis, adjustments for term and credit differences needs \\nto be applied.

The relief enables the \\ncontinuation of hedge accounting for impacted hedge relationships \\nduring the period of uncertainty prior to IBOR transition. The \\nConsolidated Entity early adopted these amendments for the year \\nended 31 March 2020. \\nIn August 2020, AASB 2020-8 Amendments to Australian \\nAccounting Standards – Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2 \\namended standards including AASB 7, AASB 9 and AASB 16 Leases \\n(AASB 16) to address accounting issues following the transition to \\nARR.

Thus, \\nat the time of modification, where the relief applies, there is no \\nimpact to the income statement. The relief requires continuation of \\nhedge accounting in circumstances when changes to hedged items \\nand hedging instruments arise as a result of changes required by the \\nIBOR reform. \\nThe amendments, which were mandatorily effective for annual \\nreporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021, also \\nrequire additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. \\nThe\\xa0Consolidated\\xa0Entity early adopted these amendments \\nfor the year ended 31\\xa0March 2021.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Changes in \\nfair value are presented in net trading income and gives rise to \\nincome statement volatility unless designated in a hedge accounting \\nrelationship, in which case the carrying value of the hedged item \\nis adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the hedged \\nrisk to reduce volatility in the income statement. If designated in \\na cash flow hedge accounting relationship, the effective portion \\nof the derivative’s fair value gains or losses is deferred in the cash \\nflow hedge reserve as part of Other comprehensive income (OCI), \\nand subsequently recognised in the income statement at the \\ntime at which the hedged item affects the income statement for \\nthe hedged risk. For segment reporting purposes, derivatives are \\naccounted for on an accrual basis in the results of the Operating \\nGroups to the extent that the Corporate segment manages the \\nderivative volatility, either through the application of hedge \\naccounting or where the derivative volatility may offset the \\nvolatility of other positions managed within the Corporate segment.\\nCentral Service Groups\\nThe Central Service Groups provide a range of functions supporting \\nMGL’s Operating Groups, ensuring they have the appropriate \\nworkplace support and systems to operate effectively and the \\nnecessary resources to meet their regulatory, compliance, financial \\nreporting, legal and risk management requirements. \\nCentral Service Groups recover their costs from Operating Groups \\ngenerally on either a time and effort allocation basis or a fee \\nfor service basis.

These models incorporate a range of components notably \\nthat of Exposure at Default (EAD), Probability of Default (PD) and \\nLoss Given Default (LGD) (‘credit inputs’) as well as Forward-Looking \\nInformation (FLI).\\nFor retail portfolios, behavioural variables are also considered in the \\ndetermination of inputs for ECL modelling. \\nThe key model inputs used in measuring the ECL include:\\n• exposure at default (EAD): The EAD represents the estimated \\nexposure in the event of a default\\n• probability of default (PD): The calculation of PDs for retail and \\nwholesale exposures is generally performed at a facility level. \\nRetail exposures are segmented based on product type and \\nshared characteristics that are highly correlated to credit risk \\nsuch as region, product, counterparty groupings, loan-to-value \\nratio and other similar criteria. Portfolio PDs are a function of \\nindustry type, internal credit ratings and transition matrices \\nused to determine a point in time PD estimate. PD estimates for \\nboth retail and wholesale portfolios are also adjusted for FLI\\n• loss given default (LGD): The LGD associated with the PD \\nused is the magnitude of the ECL in a default event. The LGD \\nis estimated using historical loss rates considering relevant \\nfactors\\xa0for individual exposures or portfolios.\\nSignificant increase in credit\\xa0risk (SICR)\\nThe Consolidated Entity periodically assesses exposures to \\ndetermine whether there has been a SICR, which may be evidenced \\nby either qualitative or quantitative factors. Qualitative factors \\ninclude, but are not limited to material change in internal credit \\nrating, whether an exposure has been identified and placed on \\nCreditWatch, an internal credit monitoring mechanism supervised \\nby the credit watch management committee to closely monitor \\nexposures showing signs of stress. All exposures on CreditWatch are \\nclassified as stage\\xa0II or, if defaulted, as stage\\xa0III.\\nSICR thresholds, which require judgement, are used to determine \\nwhether an exposure’s credit risk has increased significantly. \\nThe\\xa0SICR methodology is based on a relative credit risk approach \\nwhich considers changes in an underlying exposure’s credit risk since \\norigination. This may result in exposures being classified in stage\\xa0IIthat are of a higher credit quality than other similar exposures that \\nare classified as stage\\xa0I. Accordingly, while similar increases in the \\nquantum of stage\\xa0II exposures will suggest a relative deterioration \\nof credit quality, it should not necessarily be inferred that the assets \\nare of a lower credit quality.\\nRetail exposures\\nExposures are assigned a behavioural score which considers the \\nexposures’ lifetime PD on initial recognition. This behavioural score \\nis periodically assessed and updated to reflect changes in the \\nunderlying exposures’ credit behaviour.\\nSICR movement thresholds between origination and reporting date \\nof behavioural score movements have been established that, where \\nexceeded, result in the exposure being categorised as stage\\xa0II.\\nWholesale exposures\\nThe Consolidated Entity assigns an internal credit rating to each \\nexposure at origination based on information available at that date. \\nThese internal ratings are broadly aligned to external credit rating \\nagencies such as Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s.\\nWhere an exposures’ assigned credit rating deteriorates beyond \\npre-defined thresholds per credit rating at origination, the exposure \\nis categorised as stage\\xa0II. The methodology has been calibrated so \\nthat a larger change in rating is required for higher quality credit \\nrated exposures than for lower quality credit rated exposures to be \\nclassified as stage\\xa0II.\\nFor both retail and wholesale portfolios:\\n• the AASB\\xa09 ‘low credit risk’ exemption is not applied by the \\nConsolidated Entity to material portfolios\\n• for material retail portfolios, the credit risk for an exposure or \\nportfolio is generally deemed to have increased significantly if \\nthe exposure is more than 30 days past due, unless there are \\nproduct specific characteristics that indicate that this threshold \\nshould be rebutted.\\nDefinition of default\\nThe Consolidated Entity’s definition of default determines \\nthe\\xa0reference point for the calculation of the ECL components, and \\nin particular the PD. Default is generally defined as the point when \\nthe borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without \\nrecourse by the Consolidated Entity to actions such as realisation of \\navailable security; or the borrower is 90 days or more past due on an \\nobligation to the Consolidated Entity.\\nThe Consolidated Entity periodically monitors its exposures for \\npotential indicators of default such as significant financial difficulty \\nof the borrower including breaches of lending covenants; it is \\nprobable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial \\nreorganisation; the disappearance of an active market for that \\nfinancial asset because of financial difficulties; or the purchase or \\norigination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the \\nincurred credit losses.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Internally, \\nthe Consolidated Entity has developed an Economic Capital \\nAdequacy Model (ECAM) that is used to quantify the Consolidated \\nEntity’s aggregate level of risk. The economic capital framework \\ncomplements the management of specific risk types such as equity, \\ncredit, market and operational risk by providing an aggregate view \\nof the Consolidated Entity’s risk profile. The economic capital model \\nis used to support business decision-making and has three main \\napplications:\\n• capital adequacy assessment\\n• risk appetite setting\\n• risk-adjusted performance measurement.\\nThe Consolidated Entity is subject to minimum capital \\nrequirements\\xa0externally imposed by Australian Prudential \\nRegulation Authority (APRA).\\nA wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, MBL, is accredited \\nby APRA to apply the Basel III Foundation Internal Ratings Based \\nApproach for credit risk, the Advanced Measurement Approach \\nfor operational risk, the internal model approach for market \\nrisk and the internal model approach for interest rate risk in the \\nbanking book.\\nRegulatory capital requirements are measured at three levels of \\nconsolidation within the Consolidated Entity. MBL and certain \\nsubsidiaries which meet the APRA definition of Extended Licensed \\nEntities are reported as Level 1. Level 2 consists of MBL, its \\nsubsidiaries and its immediate parent less certain subsidiaries of \\nMBL which are deconsolidated for APRA reporting purposes. These \\ninclude entities conducting insurance, funds management and \\nnon-financial operations. Level 3 consists of the Level 2 group, other \\nbank entities excluded from Level 2 plus the Non-Bank Group. In \\ndetermining the capital requirements, transactions internal to the \\nConsolidated Entity are eliminated.As an APRA authorised and regulated Non-Operating Holding \\nCompany (NOHC), the Company is required to maintain minimum \\nregulatory capital calculated as the sum of:\\n• MBL’s minimum Tier 1 capital requirement, based on a \\npercentage of RWA plus Tier 1 deductions using prevailing APRA \\nADI Prudential Standards\\n• the Non-Bank Group capital requirement, using the Consolidated \\nEntity’s ECAM.\\nThe Consolidated Entity’s Level 3 eligible capital consists of ordinary \\nequity, certain reserves and hybrid instruments. The\\xa0overall Level \\n3 capital position is reported as an excess over the regulatory \\nimposed minimum capital adequacy\\xa0requirement.\\nThe Consolidated Entity has satisfied all internally and externally \\nimposed capital requirements at Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 \\nthroughout the financial year.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Only members of the MGL and \\nMBL Executive Committees are eligible to receive PSUs. For the PSUs allocated to Executive Committee Members, two performance hurdles \\nhave been determined and each will apply individually to 50% of the total number of PSUs awarded. Hurdles are periodically reviewed by the \\nBoard Remuneration Committee (BRC) to ensure they continue to align the interests of staff and shareholders and provide a challenging \\nbut meaningful incentive to Executive Committee members. The BRC considers historical and forecast market data, the views of corporate \\ngovernance bodies, shareholders and regulators as well as market practice. No\\xa0change has been made to the hurdles for this financial year.\\nThe hurdles are outlined below.\\nPerformance hurdle 1\\nHurdle Reference group\\n50% of the PSUs based solely on the relative average annual return on \\nordinary equity (ROE) over the vesting period compared to a reference  \\ngroup of global financial\\xa0institutions.\\nA sliding scale applies with 50% becoming exercisable above the\\xa050th \\npercentile and 100% vesting at the 75th percentile.The current reference group comprises Bank of America Corporation, \\nBarclays PLC, Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman \\nSachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Lazard Limited, Morgan \\nStanley and UBS AG.\\nPerformance hurdle 2\\nHurdle Required result\\n50% of the PSUs based solely on the compound annual growth rate (CAGR)  \\nin earnings per share (EPS) over the vesting period.A sliding scale applies with 50% becoming exercisable at EPS CAGR of \\n7.5% and 100% at EPS CAGR of 12%. For example, if EPS CAGR were \\n9.75%, 75% of the relevant awards would become exercisable.\\nUnder both performance hurdles, the objective is examined once only. Testing occurs annually on 30 June immediately before vesting on \\n1\\xa0July, based on the most recent financial year-end results available. To the extent that a condition is not met when examined, the PSUs due \\nto vest will not be exercisable upon vesting, resulting in no benefit to Executive Committee members.\\nAssumptions used to determine fair value of MEREP\\xa0awards\\nRSUs and DSUs are measured at their grant dates based on their fair value(1) and for each PSU, the awards expected to vest are measured on \\nthe basis of the assumptions below. This amount is recognised as an expense evenly over the respective vesting\\xa0periods.\\nRSUs, DSUs and PSUs relating to the MEREP plan for Executive Committee members have been granted in the current financial year in respect \\nof the 2021 performance. The accounting fair value of each of these grants is estimated using the Company’s share price on the date of grant \\nand for each PSU also incorporates a discounted cash flow method using the following key assumptions:\\n• interest rate to maturity: 0.5291% per annum\\n• expected vesting dates of PSUs: 1 July 2025\\n• dividend yield: 3.73% per annum.\\nWhile RSUs DSUs, and PSUs (for Executive Committee members) for FY2022 will be granted during the FY2023, the Company begins \\nrecognising an expense for these awards (based on an initial estimate) from 1 April 2021 related to these future grants. The expense is \\nestimated using the estimated MEREP retention for FY2022 and applying the amortisation profile to the retained amount.\\nFor PSUs, the estimate also incorporates an interest rate to maturity of 2.91% per annum, expected vesting dates of PSUs of 1 July 2026, and \\na dividend yield of 3.63% per annum. In the following financial year, the Consolidated Entity will adjust the accumulated expense recognised \\nfor the final determination of fair value for each RSU, DSU and PSU when granted and will use this valuation for recognising the expense over \\nthe remaining vesting period. The Consolidated Entity annually reviews its estimates of the number of awards (including those delivered \\nthrough MEREP) that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the employment expenses \\nin the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity (for equity settled awards), or a corresponding adjustment to liabilities \\n(for cash settled awards).\\n(1) For employees categorised as Material Risk Takers who are required to comply with the European Banking Authority Guidelines on the CRD IV remuneration requirements, the fair \\nvalue of the awards granted for performance periods after 1 April 2019 has been adjusted to take into account the prohibition of dividends on unvested awards.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The notes are collateralised by the assets transferred \\nto these vehicles and pay a return based on the returns of those\\xa0assets, with residual returns paid to the most \\nsubordinated investor. \\nThese\\xa0vehicles are created for securitising assets, including mortgages, and finance leases.\\nThe Consolidated entity also establishes SEs on behalf of customers to securitise their loans or receivables and may \\nmanage these securitisation vehicles or provide liquidity or other support. \\nThe Consolidated Entity may serve as a sponsor, servicer, underwriter, liquidity provider, derivative counterparty, \\npurchaser of notes and/or purchaser of residual income units. The Consolidated Entity \\nmay also provide redraw facilities or loan commitments to securitisation vehicles.\\nAsset-backed financing Asset-backed vehicles are used to provide tailored lending for the purchase or lease of assets transferred by the \\nConsolidated Entity or its clients.

The Consolidated Entity’s \\nobjective is to reduce the risk of volatility in earnings, within \\npre-defined thresholds.

The maturity \\nprofile for the hedging instruments’ notional amounts are reported \\nbased on their contractual maturity. Where a cross currency swap \\nhas been dual designated in both a cash flow and a fair value hedge, \\nthe notional is shown more than once. Increases in notional profiles \\nof hedging instruments are presented as negative figures, with \\ndecreases and maturities presented as positive figures.\\nHedging ineffectiveness\\nIn the case of a fair value hedge, hedge ineffectiveness is the extent \\nto which the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument \\ndiffer to that of the hedged item for the hedged risk. In the case \\nof a cash flow hedge, hedge ineffectiveness is the extent to which \\nthe change in the fair value of the hedging instrument exceeds, \\nin absolute terms, that of the hedged item. In the case of net \\ninvestment hedge relationships, hedge ineffectiveness is the extent \\nto which the change in the carrying amount of foreign currency \\ndenominated debt and foreign exchange contracts attributable to \\nthe change in exchange rates exceeds, in absolute terms, that of the \\nhedged item. Sources of hedge ineffectiveness primarily arise from \\nbasis and timing differences between the hedged items and hedging \\ninstruments, and designating existing derivatives with a non-zero \\nfair value as hedging instruments. Hedge ineffectiveness is reported \\nin net trading income in the income statement.IBOR reform\\nDuring the period, the Consolidated Entity completed the transition \\nof all remaining hedging relationships subject to mandatory \\nIBOR reform, and certain non-mandatory transition of hedge \\naccounting relationships to alternate reference rates (ARRs) as \\ndescribed in Note 1 Basis of preparation  and Note 36 Financial risk  \\nmanagement.  The Consolidated Entity has made use of the relief \\nprovided by AASB 2020-8 Amendments to Australian Accounting \\nStandards – Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Phase 2 relief) to \\namend the formal designation of these hedging relationships. \\nAs all hedge relationships subject to mandatory IBOR reform have \\nbeen transitioned, no uncertainty remains, and the Consolidated \\nEntity is no longer utilising the relief provided under AASB 2019-3 \\nAmendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Interest Rate \\nBenchmark Reform (Phase 1 relief).

All wholesale limits and ratings are \\nreviewed at least once a year or more frequently if required. \\nRetail credit exposures are monitored by the business units and \\noverseen by RMG Credit on a portfolio basis.\\nAll credit exposures are monitored regularly against limits. For \\nlimit monitoring, credit exposures for loan assets are reported \\nat amortised cost.

Macquarie’s liquidity policy is approved by the MGL and MBL \\nBoards after endorsement by the ALCO and liquidity reporting is \\nprovided to the Boards on a regular basis. The ALCO includes the \\nMGL CEO, MBL CEO, CFO, CRO, Co-Heads of Group Treasury and \\nOperating Group Heads.\\nRMG provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management, \\nincluding ownership of liquidity policies and key limits and approval \\nof material liquidity scenario assumptions.\\nLiquidity policy and risk appetite\\nThe MGL and MBL liquidity policies are designed so that each of \\nMacquarie, the Bank Group and the Non-Bank Group maintains \\nsufficient liquidity to meet its obligations as they fall due. The MBL \\nLiquidity Policy outlines the standalone framework for the Bank \\nGroup and its principles are consistent with the MGL Liquidity \\nPolicy.  Macquarie’s liquidity risk appetite is intended to ensure that \\nMacquarie is able to meet all of its liquidity obligations during a \\nperiod of liquidity stress: a twelve month period with constrained \\naccess to funding markets for MBL, no access to funding \\nmarkets for MGL and with only a limited reduction in Macquarie’s \\nfranchise\\xa0businesses.\\nReflecting the longer-term nature of the Non-Bank Group asset \\nprofile, MGL is funded predominantly with a mixture of capital and \\nlong-term wholesale funding. MBL is an authorised deposit-taking \\ninstitution and is funded mainly with capital, long-term liabilities \\nand deposits.\\nLiquidity contingency plan\\nGroup Treasury maintains a Liquidity Contingency Plan, which \\noutlines how a liquidity crisis would be managed. The plan defines \\nroles and responsibilities and actions to be taken in a liquidity event, \\nincluding identifying key information requirements and appropriate \\ncommunication plans with both internal and external parties.\\nSpecifically, the plan details:\\n• factors that may constitute a crisis\\n• the officers responsible for enacting the plan\\n• a committee of senior executives responsible for \\nmanaging a crisis\\n• the information required to effectively manage a crisis\\n• a communications strategy\\n• a high level checklist of possible actions to conserve or raise \\nadditional liquidity\\n• contact lists to facilitate prompt communication with all key \\ninternal and external stakeholders.In addition, Macquarie monitors a range of early warning indicators \\non a daily basis that might assist in identifying emerging risks in \\nMacquarie’s liquidity position. These indicators are reviewed by \\nSenior Management and are used to inform any decisions regarding \\ninvoking the\\xa0plan.\\nThe Liquidity Contingency Plan is subject to regular review by both \\nGroup Treasury and RMG. It is submitted annually to the ALCO and \\nthe MGL and MBL Boards for approval.\\nMacquarie is a global financial institution, with branches and \\nsubsidiaries in a variety of countries. Regulations in certain \\ncountries may require some branches or subsidiaries to have specific \\nlocal contingency plans. Where that is the case, the Liquidity \\nContingency Plan contains either a supplement or a reference to a \\nseparate document providing the specific information required for \\nthose branches or subsidiaries.\\nFunding strategy\\nMacquarie prepares a Funding Strategy for both MGL and MBL \\non an annual basis and monitors progress against the strategy \\nthroughout the year.\\nThe Funding Strategy aims to maintain Macquarie’s diversity of \\nfunding sources for MGL and MBL, ensure ongoing compliance with \\nall liquidity requirements and facilitate forecast asset growth.\\nThe Funding Strategy is reviewed by the ALCO and approved by \\nthe\\xa0respective Boards.\\nScenario analysis\\nScenario analysis is central to Macquarie’s liquidity risk management \\nframework. In addition to regulatory defined scenarios, Group \\nTreasury models additional liquidity scenarios covering both \\nmarket-wide and Macquarie name-specific crises.\\nThese scenarios use a range of assumptions, which Macquarie \\nintends to be conservative, regarding the level of access to capital \\nmarkets, deposit outflows, contingent funding requirements and \\nasset sales.\\nAs an example, one internal scenario projects the expected cash and \\nliquid asset position during a combined market-wide and Macquarie \\nname-specific crisis over a twelve month time frame. This scenario \\nassumes no access to wholesale funding markets, a significant loss \\nof customer deposits and contingent funding outflows resulting \\nfrom undrawn commitments, market moves impacting derivatives \\nand other margined positions combined with a multiple notch credit \\nrating downgrade.

The following factors can limit the effectiveness of \\xa0VaR in predicting future price moves:\\n• the use of historical data means that the current model parameters may not reflect future market conditions especially when entering \\na period of heightened volatility. The model utilises exponential weighting to place emphasis on the most recent market movements to \\nmore accurately reflect current conditions\\n• VaR focuses on unexceptional price moves so that it does not\\xa0account for losses that could occur beyond the 99% level of\\xa0confidence.\\nFor capital adequacy purposes, debt-specific risk is measured using APRA’s standard method, whilst all other exposures are captured by \\nthe\\xa0VaR model. This combined approach has been approved by APRA and is subject to periodic review.\\nNon-traded market risk\\nThe Consolidated Entity has exposure to non-traded market risks arising from transactions entered into during its normal course of business \\nand as a result of its investments in foreign operations. These risks include:\\n• interest rate: Changes in the level, shape and volatility of yield curves, and/or client behaviour given these changes\\n• foreign exchange:  Changes in the spot exchange rates.\\nThe Consolidated Entity has limited appetite for non-traded market risks. Where commercially feasible, these risks are transferred into \\nthe trading books of CGM and Group Treasury and governed within the traded market risk framework described above. Responsibility for \\nmanaging exposures rests with individual businesses, with additional central monitoring from FMG for foreign exchange risks. Any residual \\nnon-traded market risks are subject to independent limits approved by RMG and reported regularly to Senior\\xa0Management.\\nWhere foreign exchange exposures arise as a result of investments in foreign operations, a key objective of the Consolidated Entity’s \\nNon-traded market risk policy is to reduce the sensitivity of regulatory capital ratios to foreign currency movements. This is achieved by \\nleaving specific investments in core foreign operations exposed to foreign currency translation movements and captured in the foreign \\ncurrency translation reserve, a component of regulatory capital. This aligns the currency of capital supply with capital requirements.\\nAs a result of this policy, the Consolidated Entity is therefore partially exposed to currency risk in relation to the translation of its net \\ninvestment in foreign operations to Australian dollars. Apart from this there is no material non-trading foreign exchange risk.\\nAccounting considerations arising from hedging activities\\nThe use of derivative and other financial instruments to hedge non-traded positions potentially gives rise to income statement volatility due \\nto difference in accounting treatments. The Consolidated Entity manages this through hedge accounting as set out in Note 44(x) Derivative \\ninstruments and hedging activities  and Note 35 Hedge accounting.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

A group-wide steering committee was established \\nwith its key responsibility being the governance of the project and \\ncomprised of senior executives from the Consolidated Entity’s \\nOperating Groups, Financial Management Group (FMG), Risk \\nManagement Group (RMG), Corporate Operations Group (COG) and \\nLegal and Governance. \\nIn addition to the project’s progress outlined in Consolidated \\nEntity’s annual and interim financial statements for previous \\nperiods, the project achieved several important milestones for the \\nperiod ended 31 March 2022 including that the Consolidated Entity: \\n• has successfully transitioned all contracts referencing LIBORs \\nthat ceased publication on 31 December 2021. Some so called \\n‘tough legacy’ contracts (retail mortgages) continue to reference \\nsynthetic GBP LIBOR. The use of synthetic LIBOR is expected to \\nbe temporary and transition efforts to cease using synthetic GBP \\nLIBOR will continue in 2022\\n• is transacting across a broad range of ARR currencies and \\nproducts, supported by changes to key systems and processes.\\n• ceased using USD LIBOR in new contracts after 31 December \\n2021 aside from exceptional use cases\\n• transitioned its internal USD LIBOR, EURIBOR and CDOR funding \\nto Secured overnight financing rate (SOFR), Euro Short-Term \\nRate (ESTR) and Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA) \\nrespectively, and re-hedged external funding exposures to \\nthe relevant currency ARR, given sufficient liquidity in the \\nrelevant markets\\n• has transitioned all hedge accounting relationships impacted by \\nIBOR cessation except for a small number of USD LIBOR positions \\nwhich will mature prior to cessation.\\nGiven progress in recent years, including the recent achievements \\noutlined above, there has been a significant reduction in the \\nremaining LIBOR transition effort and risks. The key remaining task \\nis to work with clients and counterparties to transition legacy USD \\nLIBOR contracts, or ensure these contracts contain robust fallbacks, \\nto ARRs before USD LIBOR publication ceases on 30\\xa0June 2023. \\nWhilst the transition of legacy USD LIBOR contracts exposes the \\nConsolidated Entity to risks, including those outlined below, from \\n1 April 2022, the Consolidated Entity’s IBOR transition governance \\nmodel was decentralised, under which central oversight reduced \\nand parameters were established for the operating groups to \\ndeliver appropriate outcomes for the remainder of the LIBOR \\ntransition effort and risks.Macquarie has identified the following four inherent risks arising \\nfrom transition of legacy USD LIBOR contracts:\\n• financial risk: This includes (i) value transfers during transition \\nto ARRs, or triggering of fallback terms and default interest \\npayment terms, (ii) basis risk from products and currencies \\nmoving at different times, (iii) change in accounting treatment \\nimpacts including hedge accounting, capital, tax and reported \\nearnings, and (iv) loss in revenue/market share from not being \\nready to participate in ARR markets\\n• conduct risk: This includes (i) real or perceived benefit of \\ninformation asymmetry between financial institutions and \\nclients during transition, (ii) real or perceived unfair treatment of \\nclients during transition, and (iii) market participants attempt to \\ninfluence ARRs during transition or misconduct in markets where \\nthere is insufficient liquidity \\n• legal risk: This includes (i) client disputes over amendment \\nterms, (ii) litigation from clients and counterparties (including \\npotential class actions) due to inappropriate/unenforceable \\ncontractual terms or losses from transition\\n• operational risk: This includes (i) infrastructure and processes \\nthat result in errors upon transition, and (ii) reduced model \\naccuracy due to lack of historical data.\\nWhilst IBOR reforms, including the transition from LIBOR to ARRs, \\nare important changes for the Consolidated Entity, they have not \\nresulted in changes to the Consolidated Entity’s risk management \\nstrategy and these risks are managed within the existing risk \\nmanagement framework.\\nExposure yet to be transitioned to ARRs: Notional value \\ninformation relating to the Consolidated Entity’s financial \\ninstruments which are\\xa0yet to transition to ARRs as at the reporting \\ndate includes:\\n• derivatives: Derivatives exposure of $71,853 million in USD \\nLIBOR and $79 million in other currencies.

If the market for a financial instrument is \\nnot active, fair values are estimated using present value or other \\nvaluation techniques, using inputs based on market conditions \\nprevailing at the measurement date.\\nThe values derived from applying these techniques are affected by \\nthe choice of valuation model used and the underlying assumptions \\nmade regarding inputs such as timing and amounts of future cash \\nflows, discount rates, credit risk, volatility and correlation.\\nItems measured at fair value are categorised in their entirety, \\nin accordance with the levels of the fair value hierarchy as \\noutlined below:\\nLevel 1 unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for \\nidentical assets or liabilities\\nLevel 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within \\nLevel 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, \\neither directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived \\nfrom prices)\\nLevel 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on \\nobservable market data (unobservable inputs).\\nThe appropriate fair value hierarchy level for an item is determined \\non the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair \\nvalue measurement. AASB\\xa013 Fair Value Measurement  requires \\nthe use of the price within the bid-offer spread that is most \\nrepresentative of fair\\xa0value.\\nValuation systems will typically generate mid-market prices. The \\nbid-offer adjustment reflects the extent to which bid-offer costs \\nwould be incurred if substantially all of the residual net exposure \\nto market risks were closed, on a portfolio basis, using available \\nhedging instruments.\\nThe fair values calculated for financial instruments which are \\ncarried in the Statements of financial position at amortised cost \\n(as disclosed in Note 37 Measurement categories of financial \\ninstruments)  are for disclosure purposes only. The following \\nmethods and assumptions applied to derive these fair values \\ncan require significant judgement by management and therefore \\nmay not necessarily be comparable to other financial institutions \\nnor may it be the price at which the asset is sold for a liability \\nrepurchased in a market-based transaction:\\n• the fair values of liquid assets and other instruments maturing \\nwithin three months are approximate to their carrying amounts. \\nThis assumption is applied to liquid assets and the short-term \\nportion of all other financial assets and financial liabilities• the fair value of demand deposits with no fixed maturity \\napproximates their carrying amount as they are short-term in \\nnature or are payable on demand\\n• the fair values of variable rate financial instruments, including \\ncash collateral on lending and borrowing and repurchase \\nagreements approximates their carrying amounts\\n• the fair values of all loan assets, term deposits and debt \\nliabilities carried at amortised cost, is determined with reference \\nto changes in interest rates and credit spreads\\n• the fair value of fixed rate loans and debt investments carried \\nat amortised cost is estimated by reference to current market \\nrates offered on similar loans and the creditworthiness of \\nthe\\xa0borrower\\n• the fair value of issued debt securities and loan capital, where \\ncarried at amortised cost, is based on quoted prices in active \\nmarkets where available. Where quoted prices are not available \\nthe fair value is based on discounted cash flows using rates \\nappropriate to the term and incorporates changes in the \\nConsolidated Entity’s own credit spread\\n• substantially all of the Consolidated Entity’s commitments to \\nextend credit are at variable rates. As such, there is no significant \\nexposure to fair value fluctuations resulting from interest rate \\nmovements relating to these commitments.\\nThe following methods and significant assumptions have been \\napplied in determining the fair values of following items:\\n• trading assets including commodities and commodity contracts, \\ntrading liabilities, derivative financial instruments and other \\ntransactions undertaken for trading purposes are measured at \\nfair value by reference to quoted prices in active markets where \\navailable (for example listed securities). If quoted prices in active \\nmarkets are not available, then fair values are estimated on the \\nbasis of other recognised valuation\\xa0techniques\\n• repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, being \\ncollateralised financing arrangements, are measured at fair value \\nwith reference to the securities which are held or provided as the \\ncollateral for the financing agreement\\n• financial investments classified as FVTPL or FVOCI are measured \\nat fair value by reference to quoted prices in active markets \\nwhere available (for example listed securities).

Subsidiaries are all \\nthose entities (including structured entities) which the Consolidated \\nEntity controls. The Consolidated Entity controls an entity \\nwhere it has:\\n• power to direct the relevant activities\\n• exposure, or rights, to variable returns, and\\n• the ability to utilise power to affect the entity’s returns.\\nThe determination of control is based on current facts and \\ncircumstances and is continuously assessed. The Consolidated \\nEntity has power over an entity when it has existing substantive \\nrights that provide it with the current ability to direct the entity’s \\nrelevant activities, being those activities that significantly affect the \\nentity’s returns. The Consolidated Entity also considers the entity’s \\npurpose and design. If the Consolidated Entity determines that it \\nhas power over an entity, the Consolidated Entity then evaluates \\nits exposure, or rights, to variable returns by considering the \\nmagnitude and variability associated with its economic interests.\\nAll variable returns are considered in making that assessment \\nincluding, but not limited to, returns from debt or equity \\ninvestments, guarantees, liquidity arrangements, variable fees and \\ncertain derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Consolidated \\nEntity has determined that it controls entities that it has less than \\nhalf of the voting rights on the basis of its ability to direct the \\nrelevant activities of those entities.\\nStructured entities\\nStructured Entities (SEs) are those entities that have been designed \\nso that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in \\ndeciding who controls the entity, such as when voting rights \\nrelate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities of \\nthe SE are directed by means of contractual arrangements. When \\nassessing whether the Consolidated Entity controls (and therefore \\nconsolidates) a SE, judgement is required as to whether the \\nConsolidated Entity has power over the relevant activities as well as \\nexposure, or rights, to variable returns of the SE.Where the Consolidated Entity has power over the SE’s relevant \\nactivities, has assessed that its exposure to variable returns \\n(through the residual risk associated with its involvement in SEs) \\nis sufficient, and is able to affect its returns, the underlying assets, \\nliabilities, revenues and expenses of these SEs are reported in the \\nconsolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 34 Structured \\nentities  for further information related to both consolidated and \\nunconsolidated structured entities.\\nConsolidation\\nThe effects of all transactions between subsidiaries in the \\nConsolidated Entity are eliminated in full. Unrealised losses are \\neliminated in the same manner as unrealised gains but only to the \\nextent that there is no evidence of impairment.\\nNon-controlling interests (NCI) in the results and equity of \\nsubsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated income \\nstatement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and \\nconsolidated Statements of financial position and are determined \\non the basis of the Consolidated Entity’s present ownership interest \\nin the entity.\\nWhere control of an entity was obtained during the financial year, \\nits results are included in the consolidated income statement from \\nthe date on which control was obtained. Where control of an entity \\nceased during the financial year, its results are included for that part \\nof the financial year during which control existed.\\nThe Consolidated Entity determines the dates of obtaining control \\n(i.e. acquisition date) and losing control (i.e. disposal date) of \\nanother entity based on an assessment of all pertinent facts \\nand circumstances that affect the ability to direct the relevant \\nactivities and the extent of the Consolidated Entity’s exposure to \\nthe entity’s variable returns. Facts and circumstances that have the \\nmost impact include the contractual arrangements agreed with \\nthe counterparty, the manner in which those arrangements are \\nexpected to operate in practice and whether regulatory approval \\nis required (including the nature of such approval). The acquisition \\nor disposal date does not necessarily occur when the transaction is \\nclosed or finalised under law.\\nSubsidiaries held by the Company are carried in its financial \\nstatements at cost less accumulated impairment.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In-substance ownership interests are interests \\nthat are substantially similar to an investee’s ordinary shares. Equity \\naccounting of the ownership interests is applied from the date that \\nthe Consolidated Entity has significant influence or joint control \\nand ceases when the Consolidated Entity no longer has significant \\ninfluence or joint control.\\nThe Consolidated Entity determines the dates of obtaining or losing \\nsignificant influence or joint control of another entity based on an \\nassessment of all pertinent facts and circumstances that affect the \\nability to significantly influence the financial and operating policies \\nor jointly control the relevant activities of that entity. Facts and \\ncircumstances that have the most impact include the contractual \\narrangements agreed with the counterparty, the manner in which \\nthose arrangements are expected to operate in practice, and \\nwhether regulatory approval is required (including the nature of \\nsuch approval). The acquisition or disposal date does not necessarily \\noccur when the transaction is closed or finalised under law.\\nThe equity method of accounting is applied in the consolidated \\nFinancial Report and requires the recognition of the Consolidated \\nEntity’s share of its associates’ and joint ventures’ post acquisition \\nprofits or loss (including impairments of the associates’ or joint \\nventures’ assets) in the consolidated income statement, and the \\nshare of the post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive \\nincome in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. \\nTransactions reported directly in equity (besides those reflected in \\nother comprehensive income) are accounted for by the Consolidated \\nEntity in accordance with the substance of the transaction and \\nwhether the transaction is dilutive to the Consolidated Entity’s \\nownership interest. Where the transaction is dilutive, the impact \\nis recorded as part of the Consolidated Entity’s share of profits or \\nlosses of associates and joint ventures.\\nEquity accounting of losses is restricted to the Consolidated Entity’s \\ninterests in its associate or joint venture, unless the Consolidated \\nEntity has an obligation or has made payment on behalf of \\nthe entity.\\nLong-term interests in an associate or joint venture, to which the \\nequity method is not applied but in-substance form part of the net \\ninvestment in the associate or joint venture, are accounted for in \\naccordance with the Consolidated Entity’s financial instruments’ \\naccounting policies, which includes accounting for expected credit \\nlosses, where applicable. Subsequently, the loss allocation and \\nimpairment requirements in AASB 128 Investments in Associates \\nand Joint Ventures  are applied to long-term interests.At the end of each reporting period, management reviews the \\nConsolidated Entity’s investments in associates and joint ventures \\nfor indicators of impairment. Where there is an indicator of \\nimpairment, the carrying amount of the investment is tested for \\nimpairment by comparing its recoverable amount with its carrying \\nvalue. Impairment losses are recognised in other impairment \\ncharges/reversal. A reversal of a previously recognised impairment \\nloss is recognised only to the extent that the investment’s carrying \\nvalue does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been \\ndetermined (including consideration of any equity accounted losses) \\nif no impairment loss had been recognised.\\nInterests in associates and joint ventures are classified as held for \\nsale when the Consolidated Entity determines that the interest \\nwill be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than \\nthrough continuing use. Equity accounting is suspended when the \\ninterest is classified as held for sale.\\nOn disposal of an investment in an associate or a joint venture, the \\ndifference between the sales consideration, any retained interest \\nand the carrying value is recognised as a gain or loss in investment \\nincome as part of other operating income and charges together \\nwith any gains and losses in OCI that related to the associate or \\njoint venture.\\nChanges in ownership interests\\nWhen acquiring additional interests:\\n• of a financial asset (such that it becomes an associate,  \\njoint venture or subsidiary), or\\n• in an investment in an associate or joint venture (such that it \\nbecomes a subsidiary), where the underlying entity constitutes \\na business,\\npreviously held interests are revalued to their fair value and any gain \\nor loss is recognised in investment income as part other operating \\nincome and charges.\\nSimilarly, when selling ownership interests of a subsidiary (such \\nthat control is lost), or an investment in an associate or joint \\nventure (such that it becomes a financial asset), retained ownership \\ninterests are revalued to their fair value and any gain or loss is \\nrecognised in investment income as part of other operating income \\nand charges. Retained ownership interests are not revalued where \\nthe sale represents a contribution to an associate or joint venture.\\nIncreases and decreases in the Consolidated Entity’s interest in a \\nsubsidiary (that do not result in the loss of control) are accounted \\nfor directly within equity. Increases in the Consolidated Entity’s \\nownership interest in an associate or joint venture are accounted \\nfor as an increase in the carrying value of the interest in associate \\nor joint venture. The difference between the reduction in the \\nConsolidated Entity’s interest in an associate or joint venture \\nthat remains an associate or joint venture and the fair value of \\nconsideration received is accounted for as a gain or loss within \\ninvestment income as part of other operating income and charges. \\nA proportionate amount of associated OCI is reclassified to profit or \\nloss, or reclassified within equity, as would otherwise be required on \\ndisposal of the underlying position.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The Consolidated Entity identifies a business \\nwhere an acquired integrated set of activities and assets includes an \\neconomic resource (input) and a substantive process that together \\nsignificantly contribute to the ability to provide goods or services \\nto customers, generate investment income or other income from \\nordinary activities (outputs).\\nOn a transaction-by-transaction basis, the Consolidated Entity \\nmay use a practical expedient to determine that an acquired set of \\nactivities is not a business. Under this assessment, the transaction \\nis accounted for as an asset acquisition if substantially all of the \\nfair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single \\nidentifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets.\\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition \\nmethod. The consideration exchanged is measured as the aggregate \\nof the acquisition-date fair values of assets transferred, equity \\ninstruments issued, and liabilities incurred. Transaction costs of a \\nbusiness combination are recognised directly in the consolidated \\nincome statement as part of other operating expenses.\\nIdentifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities \\nassumed in a business combination are measured at fair value \\non the acquisition date. The Consolidated Entity elects, on a \\ntransaction-by-transaction basis, to initially measure NCI either at \\nfair value or at the NCI’s proportionate share of the fair values of \\nthe identifiable assets and liabilities.\\nGoodwill is measured as the excess of the consideration exchanged, \\nrecognised NCI, and the fair value of previously held equity interests \\nover the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the business \\nacquired and is recognised as part of intangible assets in the \\nStatements of financial position.

Where such a contingent event exists, the \\nConsolidated Entity does not have the unconditional right to avoid \\ndelivering cash or another financial asset and the capital instrument \\nis classified as a financial liability. The financial liability is initially \\nmeasured at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs \\nand is subsequently measured at amortised cost.\\nFor compound instruments that have both equity and liability \\nfeatures, the liability component is initially measured at fair value \\nplus directly attributable transaction costs (and is thereafter \\nmeasured at amortised cost using the EIR method), with the \\nresidual being accounted for within the Consolidated Entity’s equity.\\n(xxii)\\u2008 Impairment\\nExpected credit losses\\nThe ECL requirements apply to financial assets measured at \\namortised cost or FVOCI, lease receivables, amounts receivable \\nfrom contracts with customers, loan commitments, certain letters \\nof credit and financial guarantee contracts issued that are not \\nDFVTPL. The Consolidated Entity applies a three-stage approach \\nto measuring the ECL based on changes in the financial asset’s \\nunderlying credit risk and includes forward looking information (FLI).\\nThe calculation of ECL requires judgement and the choice of inputs, \\nestimates and assumptions. Refer to Note 13 Expected credit losses  \\nfor further information. Outcomes within the next financial period \\nthat are different from management’s assumptions and estimates \\ncould result in changes to the timing and amount of ECL to be \\nrecognised.The ECL is determined with reference to the following stages:\\n(i)\\u2008Stage I—12 month ECL\\nAt initial recognition, and for financial assets for which there has \\nnot been a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial \\nrecognition, ECL is determined based on the probability of default \\n(PD) over the next 12 months and the lifetime losses associated \\nwith such PD, adjusted for FLI. Stage I also includes financial assets \\nwhere the credit risk has improved and has been reclassified \\nfrom stage II.\\n(ii)\\u2008Stage II—Not credit-impaired\\nWhen there has been a SICR since initial recognition, the ECL is \\ndetermined with reference to the financial asset’s lifetime PD \\nand the lifetime losses associated with that PD, adjusted for FLI. \\nThe Consolidated Entity exercises judgement in determining \\nwhether there has been a SICR since initial recognition based \\non qualitative, quantitative, and reasonable and supportable \\ninformation that includes FLI. Detail on the Consolidated Entity’s \\nprocess to determine whether there has been a SICR is provided in \\nNote\\xa013\\xa0Expected credit losses.\\nUse of alternative criteria could result in significant changes to \\nthe timing and amount of ECL to be recognised. Lifetime ECL \\nis generally determined based upon the contractual maturity \\nadjusted, where appropriate, for prepayments, extension, call and \\nsimilar options, of the financial asset. For revolving facilities, the \\nConsolidated Entity exercises judgement based on the behavioural, \\nrather than contractual characteristics of the facility type. Stage II \\nmay include financial assets where the credit risk has improved and \\nhas been reclassified from stage III.\\n(iii)\\u2008Stage III—Credit-impaired\\nFinancial assets are classified as stage III where they are determined \\nto be credit impaired, which generally matches the APRA definition \\nof default. This includes exposures that are at least 90 days past due \\nand where the obligor is unlikely to pay without recourse against \\navailable collateral.\\nThe ECL for credit impaired financial assets is generally measured \\nas the difference between the contractual and expected cash \\nflows from the individual exposure, discounted using the EIR for \\nthat exposure.

The main \\nindicators of impairment are significant changes in the market, \\neconomic or legal environment and a significant or prolonged \\ndecline in fair value below cost.\\nIn making this judgement, the Consolidated Entity evaluates, among \\nother factors, the normal volatility in share price and the period \\nof time for which fair value has been below cost. If there is an \\nindication that an investment in an associate or joint venture may \\nbe impaired, then the entire carrying amount of the investment in \\nthe associate or joint venture is tested for impairment by comparing \\nthe recoverable amount, being the higher of fair value less costs to \\nsell and value-in-use, with its carrying amount.\\nImpairment losses recognised in the income statement for \\ninvestments in associates and joint ventures are subsequently \\nreversed through the income statement if there has been a change \\nin the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount since \\nthe impairment loss was recognised.

Forecasts are extrapolated \\nusing a growth rate and discounted using a pre-tax discount rate \\nincorporating market risk determinants, adjusted for specific risks \\nrelated to the cash generating units, if any, and the environment in \\nwhich it operates.\\nImpairment of investments in subsidiaries\\nInvestments in subsidiaries in the Company’s financial statements \\nare reviewed annually for indicators of impairment or more \\nfrequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that \\nthe carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment is \\nrecognised in other impairment charges/reversal, for the amount \\nby which the investment’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable \\namount, being the higher of fair value less costs to sell and \\nvalue-in-use. At each reporting date, investments in subsidiaries \\nthat have been impaired are reviewed for possible reversal of \\nimpairment. The amount of any reversal of impairment recognised \\nmust not cause the investment’s carrying value to exceed its \\noriginal cost.\\nImpairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; property, plant \\nand equipment and right-of-use assets\\nIntangible assets with indefinite lives (goodwill and certain \\nintangible assets) are not subject to amortisation but are tested \\nannually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes \\nin circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be \\nrecoverable.\\nFor intangible assets that have a finite useful life and property, plant \\nand equipment and ROU assets, an assessment is made at each \\nreporting date for indications of impairment.\\nImpairment losses are recognised in other impairment charges \\nas part of other operating income and charges for the amount by \\nwhich the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. \\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s fair value less \\ncosts to sell and value-in-use.\\nFor the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at \\nthe lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash \\ninflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from \\nother assets or groups of assets (cash-generating units).

Information relating to \\nthese schemes is set out in Note 32 Employee equity participation.\\nThe Consolidated Entity accounts for its share-based payments \\nas follows:\\nEquity settled awards: The awards are measured at their grant \\ndate fair value and based on the number of equity instruments \\nexpected to vest. Expenses are recognised as part of employment \\nexpenses with a corresponding increase in equity with reference to \\nthe vesting period of those awards. Performance hurdles attached \\nto Performance Share Units (PSUs) under the MEREP are not taken \\ninto account when determining the fair value of the PSUs at the \\ngrant date. Instead, these vesting conditions are taken into account \\nby adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest. \\nOn vesting, the amount recognised in the share-based payments \\nreserve is transferred to contributed equity. For the Company, the \\naccounting is dependent on whether the Company is compensated \\nfor its obligations under the MEREP award. To the extent that \\nemploying subsidiaries compensate the Company for the MEREP \\noffered to their employees, a recharge liability due to subsidiaries is \\nrecognised by the Company at grant date representing the payment \\nreceived in advance of the award being settled. This liability reduces \\nover the vesting period with a corresponding increase in the \\nshare-based payments reserve. MEREP liabilities are recognised \\nand disclosed in Note 30 Related party information.  To the extent \\nthat employing subsidiaries do not compensate the Company \\nfor the MEREP offered to their employees’, the Company reflects \\nthe provision of the equity settled award as a contribution to its \\nsubsidiary and as a result increases its investment in the subsidiary \\nwith a corresponding increase in the share-based payments reserve. \\nOn vesting, amounts recognised in the share-based payments \\nreserve are transferred to contributed equity.\\nCash settled awards: The award liability is measured with \\nreference to the number of awards and the fair value of those \\nawards at each reporting date. Expenses are recognised as part \\nof employment expenses with reference to the vesting period of \\nthose awards. Changes in the value of the liability are recognised in \\nemployment expenses.\\nProfit share remuneration\\nThe Consolidated Entity recognises a liability and an expense for \\nprofit share remuneration to be paid in cash with reference to the \\nperformance period to which the profit share relates.(xxiv)\\u2008 Leases\\nAt the inception of a contract, the Consolidated Entity assesses \\nwhether a contract is, or contains, a lease.

Leases are \\nrecognised as an ROU asset (as explained in Note 44(xiv) Property, \\nplant and equipment and right-of-use assets ) and a corresponding \\nliability at the commencement date, being the date the leased asset \\nis available for use by the Consolidated Entity.\\nLease liability\\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the \\nfuture lease payments at the commencement date, discounted \\nusing the interest rate implicit in the lease (or if that rate cannot be \\nreadily determined, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate). Lease \\npayments are allocated between principal and interest expense. \\nInterest expense is, unless capitalised on a qualifying asset which \\nis not measured at fair value, recognised as part of interest and \\nsimilar expense over the lease period on the remaining lease liability \\nbalance for each period. Any variable lease payments not included \\nin the measurement of the lease liability are also recognised as net \\noperating lease income in the period in which the event or condition \\nthat triggers those payments occurs.\\nLease liabilities are remeasured when there is a change in future \\nlease payments arising from a change in lease term, an assessment \\nof an option to purchase the underlying asset, an index or rate,\\xa0or \\na change in the estimated amount payable under a residual \\nvalue\\xa0guarantee.\\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured, a corresponding adjustment \\nis made to the carrying value of the ROU asset, or, as net operating \\nlease income, where the carrying value of the ROU asset has been \\nreduced to zero.\\nPresentation\\nThe Consolidated Entity presents ROU assets in Property, plant \\nand equipment and right-of-use assets (refer to Note 15) and lease \\nliabilities in other liabilities (refer to Note 23) in the Statements of \\nfinancial position.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This relationship with \\nDisney, Fox, and NBC Universal is a major reason why Hulu has become the de \\nfacto “next day” destination for popular broadcast shows.  Despite this availability of \\nrecent shows, however, Hulu has seen its subscriber gro wth lag over the years along \\nwith a somewhat limited content invest ment, particularly in original content .  With a \\nrecent strategic shift towards greater investment from its owners, more exclusive \\nshows like Fear The Walking Dead, and a clearer focus on su bscriber growth, \\npopularity of the service has picked up and Hulu is becoming a more viable \\nalternative to Netflix and Amazon Prime , in our view .\\nSubscriber levels approaching 10 million with users also watching more video\\nHulu currently has around 10 mill ion US subscribers to its $7.99/month all -access \\nsubscription plan , a level that still trails far behind category leader Netflix a t 42.3m\\ndomestic streaming subscribers as of Q2 2015 (Figure 1 below shows subs over \\ntime), though Hulu subscriptions have increased rapidly as of late, nearly  double the \\n5.1m at 2013 year end, and with the CEO noting at anApril 2015 Newfront \\npresentation that subscriber levels had increased around 50% from a year earlier.\\nFigure 1: Hulu and Netflix Year End US Streaming Subs (2010 -2015E)\\nin millions\\nSource:  Company data, J.P.

Hulu has \\nnonetheless favored a lighter ad load (60 to 90 seconds per ad break ) relative to \\ntraditional linear broadcast and cable TV offerings as it seeks to benefit from the high \\nCPMs that are associated with its content without overloading consumers.

Morgan estimates .\\nBroadcast owners have fueled \"next day availability” of key shows\\nBroadcast owners Fox, ABC (Disney) and NBC (Comcast) , each of which holds a \\n1/3 equity stake, have historically supplied Hulu with its unique and most valuable\\nfeature, current season episodes of popular shows available either the next day or \\nwithin a few days following airing .  Hulu also has a similar, five -year content deal \\nstructured with CW, which is jointly own ed by CBS and Warner Brothers (TWX).  \\nThis next day  broadcast viewing has differentiated Hulu from Netflix, which is \\ntypically  seen as a source for past seasons of popular shows, though it has also \\nbeefed up its supply of current season offerings with rece nt deals and originals .  A \\nseries of high profile exclusive broadcast SVOD deals as of late (Empire, Sleepy \\nHollow , Nashville and others) provide full past seasons but sometimes only a few \\ncurrent season episodes as content owners attempt to enforcewindow ingfor on \\ndemand viewing .  The supply of new broadcast content is only one part of Hulu’s \\nincreasing content investment strategy, which is also growing its library of hits like \\nSeinfeld as well as Hulu original shows, as described below.\\nCurrent o utlook f avors organic growth for the foreseeable future…\\nFollowing two aborted sales attempts in recent years , as well as a change in senior \\nmanagement, Hulu appears more committed now than ever to growing the company \\norganically .  In July 2013, the joint owners took the service in a new direction, \\ncalling off a rather public sale attempt in which they had reportedly sought ~$2b and \\nfielded offers from several major players in the content ecosystem (reportedly \\nincluding DirecTV, Time Warner Cable, and the Chernin Group , with concerns \\namong potential buyers around how much broadcast content would still be available \\nto an independent Hulu ).  Instead of selling, Hulu’s owners doubled down on \\nsupplying content to the site, announcing a $750m commitment for new content as \\nwell as technology.

A healthy \\nSVOD marketplace with several content b uyers -including a strong Hulu poised to \\ncompete with Netflix -only helps content owners by ensuring multiple bidders for \\nstudio content as syndication and licensing options grow with these new platforms.  \\nNearly  every  large cap media company o f scale ha s in the last year addressed the \\npossibility or inevitability of over the top direct to consumer offerings, and front and \\ncenter is Netflix's r apid growth (now at 42.3 m US streaming subscribers), \\nhighlighting a total addressable market that continues to gr ow and create value.\\n...While a sale could stilloccur down the road\\nDown the road, we believe that Hulu’s owners cou ld eventually still seek a sale (with \\nFox as a potential buyer, as we discuss below), though we think two key objectives \\nwould need to be m et in order for this to happen.  1)First, we think the current \\nowners want to ensure that Hulu has a stable of exclusive originals that will allow it \\nto thrive on a standalone basis .  This is similar to the pivot that Netflix began in early \\n2013 as it adde d House of Cards and Arrested Development , followed by Orange is \\nthe New  Black ,in order to build a “must have” exclusive brand and hedge against its \\nreliance on studio content.  2)Second, we think any prospective owner would need to \\nensure that they have long-term contracts in place providing continued access to the \\nexpansive library of broadcast content from Hulu’s current suppliers .\\nRecent Strategic Changes\\nHulu is moving aggressive lyto capture a bigger piece of \\nthe growing SVOD market.\\nStep up in i nvestments reflected in Seinfeld , CSI, and Fear The Walking Dead\\nHulu’s e quity  owners followed aJuly 2013 sale attempt (which was well covered by \\nthe media press) by agreeing to invest more in content , promising $750m combined\\nandstarting what we view as avirtuous cycle of greater content and subscribers that \\nwe expect to continue. More hits from broadcast are now available first and/or \\nexclusively on Hulu, highlighting the greatest strength of the service (an implied \\nright of first refusal on the robust , popular primetime content at broadcast networks). \\nThere’s also a growing stable of Hulu originals, though this is still nascent, behind \\nNetflix and Amazon, and awaiting a breako ut hit to give the service cache . Major \\nHollywood producers are onboard for u pcoming releases, suggesting this buzzworthy \\ntitle could appear sooner rather than later.\\nIn some cases, Hulu has also catered to its broadcast owners by agreeing to pay up \\nfor content that is also available via current season stacking on VOD.  Netflix \\nreportedly turned down its negotiations to license Empire from Fox because of the \\nstacking (which Netflix claimed de -valued the property), and Hulu subsequently paid \\neven more for exclusive rights while still allowing Fox to stack the season (WSJ, \\nJune 2015).

Hulu naturally faces the challenge of growing subscribers on \\nthe new tier while limiting cannibalization to its ad supported tier.  We view this new \\noffering as largely experimental given that 1 )the size of the ad market for premium \\nonline video is still unknown, and Hulu meanwhile risks cutting into its own ad \\nmarket share and 2)the SVOD marketplace is still in a price discover y phase, with a\\nwide range of offerings from $5 .99 to $15 per month. We estimate that an exist ing \\nHulu subsc riber will generate more than $7/month (see Figure 6 below) in \\nadvertising , declining to around $5/month in 2017 as subscribers grow faster than \\nadvertising, while a Hulu ad free subscription generates an incremental $4.00 per \\nmonth.  Still, we see this as an opportunity for Hulu as there may be a substantial \\nmarket of SVOD consumers who would not sign up for an ad supported service, and \\nthe $11.99/month price seems reasonable when considering the exclusive, next day \\navailability  of several popular shows such as Empire and Sleepy Hollow that may  \\nhelp justify the premium over Netflix, which is known for offering only past seasons \\nof current shows.  $11.99 per mo nth also sits in the mid -range of the growing group \\nof OTT services when considering the more expensive prices for Showtime and \\nHBO's direct to consumer services. \\nFigure 6: Hulu 2015E Advertising Per Subscriber\\nSource: Company data, J.P.

From this perspective, Hulu’s owners likely \\nwould prefer to add subscribers by nearly any means necessary as opposed to seeing \\nthem sign up for rival services.\\nDual Reve nue Model Simil ar to Cable TV\\nHulu could become de facto online destination for \\nadvertisers seeking premium video inventory\\nAdvertising revenue sets Hulu a part\\nAmong the most popular domestic SVOD service s (Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu), \\nonly Hulu features an advertising su pported model, an important distinction with \\nseveral implications.  First, it produces the same lucrative dual revenue stream of \\nfees and advertising that has supported robust growth in the traditional cable model. \\nThis also is a notable distinction for ne twork owners who recognize that selling to \\nNetflix or Amazon could encourage consumers to become accustomed to an ad free \\non demand viewing experience, and it's also a major concern for an industry that \\nalready  grapples with heavy DVR usage in the linear e nviro nment (ad skipping \\nviewership is not counted in the standard Nielsen C3 currency that networks, \\nagencies, and marketers use to price ad inventory).  Yet the industry may have the \\nopportunity to steer viewers back towards advertising given that 1)it's fairly  easy  for \\nVOD/SVOD services to make it impossible to skip their ads and 2)IP based services \\nlike Hulu may be able to limit advertising loads and make up the revenue on higher Total advertising ($m) $771\\nAverage subs (m) 8.8\\nAd revenue per sub per month $7.30\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Morgan estimates.\\nValue of Hulu i nventory stems from quality and v iewability\\nHulu also delivers high CPMs because it offers among the highest quality and most \\ndesirable online video inventory, considering that much of the video consumed \\nonline is either shor t form user generated such as YouTube or auto play video such \\nas Facebook or popular sites like ABC News.com in which video plays whether or \\nnot users want to watch it, leading to questions around viewability. Not only is most \\nHulu programming among the hi ghest quality and most popular prime time shows, \\nbut it\\'s also a classic \"lean back\" passive TV environment because viewers are not \\nsurfing, scrolling, or otherwise distracted by page or app elements once the show \\nstarts playing.  Our channel checks with a dvertisers and agencies indicate that digital \\nvideo is one of the most sought after formats, and advertisers are willing to pay \\nnotable premiums ,especially when ad skipping is limited and targeted user \\ninformation is available. These premiums should only rise when these videos grow in \\nadoption and attain a broader reach. We believe ads on Hulu average $50 CPMs, a \\nmeaningful premium to traditional media, so even on a limited basis (both in terms of \\nnumber of ads and impressions) this model should be ver y lucrative for Hulu. See \\npage 20 for a detailed list of CPMs across media.\\nIt is important to note that not all of this ad revenue is kept by Hulu, as we believe \\nadvertising is split with the “next day\" content owners .It is assumed that more than \\nhalf of ad revenue goes to the content owners, though the terms have not been \\ndisclosed.  Furthermore, in the new ad free tier, it is our understanding tha t a portion \\nof the premium pricing goes to the content providers to supplement the lost ad \\nrevenue.\\nAd growth at Hulu helps chart c ourse towards profitability\\nWe believe that Hulu\\'s annual advertising revenue is growing to levels that may \\nallow it to achie ve profitability in 2017 even as the service plows through a heavy 15,606.43 15.61\\n19,855.68 19.86\\nTelevision\\n34%\\nDigital\\n34%Newspapers\\n6%Magazine\\n4%Radio\\n7%Out of Home\\n4%Directories\\n1%Direct Mail\\n10%\\n$23.0$32.0$42.8$58.8$76.2$94.9\\n$0$10$20$30$40$50$60$70$80$90$100\\n2009 2011 2013 2015E 2017E 2019Ein $, billions\\nUS Online Display & Video Ads That \\nAre In -View, Q2 2015\\nSource: eMarketer, Integral Ad Science, Aug \\n2015 ; Note: excludes mobile .37.2%39.9%50.1%\\nOnline display bought from networks/exchanges\\nVideo adsOnline display ads bought from publishers', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

As the business \\nreaches profit ability and subscribers continue to grow, we think that the confluence \\nof advertising and fee based revenue will lead to a virtuous cycle and make the asset \\nmore attractive. \\nFrom a valuation perspective, the dual revenue stream also leads Hulu to a higher\\naverage revenue per user (ARPU), a greater value per subscriber, and a per \\nsubscriber valuation premium relative to SVOD peers, as we discuss in our Hulu \\nvaluation analysis.  \\nFOXA  Could Buy In Hulu From Partners , \\nThough They Aren’t Likely to Sell Soon\\nHulu’s owners control the broadcast content that is critical to its s uccess\\nHulu's owners must ultimately decide if the asset is largely viewed as a conduit for \\nthe success of its trifecta of owner -networks (Fox, ABC, and NBC), helping to drive \\nvalue of their marquee hits like Empire , or if it should be spun off as a separate \\nentity , potentially unlocking tremendous value which can be realized by the owners. \\nIn our view, FOXA demonstrates the most interest in owning the asset outright. \\nHowever, w hile other parties had clearly contemplated a sale in the past, there is no \\nreason to believe that today they want to part with their stake in Hulu. In an \\nenviro nment where control over content is becoming more of an issue (as the \\nproliferatio n of content is further enabling or even encouraging consumers to cut the \\ncord, and disrupting media companies' core business), Hulu’s owners may want to \\nstay involved with this asset at least in the intermediate term to participate in the \\ngrowing OTT market while still exercisin g control over the content. Over time, \\nespecially  if the value grows, the owners may be more encouraged to monetize this \\nasset either through a sale or the public markets. Either way, we see real value down \\nthe road that is not currently reflected in the p arent companies’ current valuation.\\nWe believe Fox’s interest in digital distribution is g rowing\\nWe think that Fox has displayed an increasing interest in over the top distribution -\\nincluding its summer 2014 bid for Time Warner that according to press rep orts (WSJ, \\n“Time Warner, Fox Extol the Single Life, Aug. 6 2014 ) was in part fueled by its \\ninterest in the fast growing HBO Go service and its potential for digital distribution\\n(Fox's bid came before HBO announced its own direct to consumer offering).

With streaming video, \\nhowever, each film or TV show had to be individ ually  licensed, and studios \\nappreciated increased control over the licensing and distribution process compared to \\nDVD rentals .\\nThe domestic SVOD market has grown rapidly in recent years, with a combined \\n~75m streaming subscribers from the three dominant pl ayers Netflix, Amazon Prime \\nVideo, and Hulu (a handful of services have been speculat ed but never launched , and \\nstill others have been cancelled, such as Verizon’s ill -fated joint venture with Redbox \\nthat endedlast October after failing to gain traction) .  There has been much debate \\naround the total addressable market for SVOD in the domestic market, with views \\nevolving along with Netflix's meteoric rise.  Only a few years ago, it was widely \\nbelieved that ~30m was the ceiling for a single service given tha t HBO, as the most \\nsuccessful premium network comparable, had never meaningfully surpassed that \\nlevel.  This view was based on the idea that SVOD services are largely incremental \\nto the bundle, meaning they are services purchased above and beyond a basic c able \\npackage and thus would likely appeal to the upper end of the consumer market.  \\nNetflix , for its part, has steadfastly maintained that the addressable market for its \\nservice could be as high as 75 -100m homes in the US .\\nFigure 12: Estimated US SVOD S ubscribers, 2015E –2019E*\\nin millions\\nSource:  SNL Kagan, J.P.

Of cours e, licensing deals from major studios were \\nnecessary, and major studios such as Disney/ABC, Fox, Viacom, Warner Brothers, \\nCBS, Sony, and LionsGate saw SVOD as a burgeoning revenue stream to \\ncomplement traditional syndication and licensing deals.  The emerg ence of these \\ndigital deals was particularly fortuitous for the studios given the maturity of the \\ntraditional cable bundle (Figure 14 below shows a flattish pay TV landscape even as \\nUS households have increased in recent years) , as it has provided another growing \\nrevenue stream for Big Media and created increasing demand for content.  In \\naddition, growing networks focused on serialized originals discovered that \"binge \\nviewing” by consumers of SVOD services could help boost ratings for subsequent \\nseasons, a strategy implemented to great effect with Breaking Bad (Sony) and The \\nWalking Dead (AMC) , as shown in Figure 15 below .\\nFigure 14: US TV Households and Pay TV Households, 2011 –2019E *\\nin millions\\nSource:  SNL Kagan, J.P.

At the time, the expensive \\noriginals (Netflix spent $100m on the first two seasons of HOC , according to The \\nHollyw ood Reporter , 03/23/2011 ) were viewed as risky, though they ultimately \\nhelped to drive more subscr ibers to the service. Netflix has said that its goal was to \\nemulate the HBO model of premium, exclusive content, and that the two services \\nwould come to more closely resemble each other over time.

Netflix \\ndescribes itself as a “ movie and TV series entertainment network” and has compared \\nits business to that of HBO, with its expectation that the two services will come to \\nresemble each other over time as Netflix grows its catalogue of prestige exclusives, \\nbut a key  distinction is t hat HBO owns almost all of the content it airs while Netflix \\nprimarily distributes content owned by 3rd party studios.

Quadrani\\n(1-212) 622 -1896\\nalexia.quadrani@jpmorgan.com\\nHBO Now\\nUnlike Netflix and Hulu, HBO Now is an extension of a service (HBO) that \\noriginated within –and to a large extent is reliant upon –the traditional cable TV \\necosystem that distributes its content to more than 30 million US households. This \\nhas placed its owner, Time Warner, in a somewhat awkward position as it balances \\nrelatio nships with traditional MVPDs while building its own direct to consumer \\nservice. The service launched in April with a $14.99/month price that was designed \\nto keep its distributors happy by not undercutting them, but it is also more expensive \\nthan Hulu and Netflix.  As the first over the top offering among traditional so called \\npremium networks that also include Showtime, Starz, and EPIX, HBO has also found \\nitself in somewhat of a first mover position among this group.  HBO has not yet \\nreleased subscriber da ta for HBO Now.  It is also positioning itself at the high end of \\nSVOD offerings given its reputation for premium, expensive shows like Game of \\nThrones, prestige dramas and comedies, and award winning documentaries, as well \\nas theatrical output from 3 majo r Hollywood studios. \\nShowtime \\nShowtime followed HBOs lead, launching its OTT service in July to coincide with \\nnew seasons of hit shows Ray Donovan and Masters of Sex. Like HBO Now, it was \\ninitially  made available on Apple iOS devices, though it was also added to Roku, \\nPlayStation Vue, and in a somewhat innovative move, the service was packaged as \\nan add on to Hulu for the discounted price of $9/month.  This differs from HBO \\nNow, whose price is still 14.99/month even as an add on with services such as DISH\\nSling.  Showtime is also for sale as a broadband add on through partner Cablevision, \\nwho had previously announced it would distribute HBO Now and Hulu, respectively.   \\nUnlike HBO, however, Showtime does not have as robust a pipeline of current \\ntheatrical titles, and it has not historically owned all of its own TV shows.  While \\nownership has increased dramatically in recent years and now accounts for nearly all \\nof the programming, there are exceptions such as hit Homeland, which is produced \\nby 20th Century Fox Television. \\nCBS All Access\\nAll Access is the first broadcast product to go direct to consumer, with CBS taking \\nadvantage of the fact that it is less reliant on the cable bundle relative to peers that \\nalso own larger cable network groups (Fox, NBC/Comc ast, and ABC/Disney).  CBS \\nis also the only major broadcaster that doesn’t stream any current season content on \\nHulu (they are not an owner), so CBS All Access may be an alternative. At the same \\ntime, CBS is the most reliant of all the network owners on its broadcast business and \\nwas arguably the most at risk in the recent dispute with Aereo over retransmitting \\nbroadcast signals online. By aggressively building out a retail product, CBS is \\nhedging in case of any threat to retransmission fees from within t he bundle (a \\nrevenue stream that is nearly 100% margin and which CBS is guiding to greater t han \\n$2b by 2020).  All Access costs $5.99 /month and offers most CBS prime time \\ncontent, with notable exceptions of NFL football and some hits like Big Bang Theory \\nand 2 B roke Girls, which are owned by Warner Bros. \\nNoggin\\nNoggin is Nickelodeon’s preschool kids (age 2 -6) focused SVOD offering, and it 's \\nrollout in March is arguably a defensive response to the success of Netflix in \\nattracting viewership among families with kids.

RSN/ skinny  bundle concerns will also prevail, although we are \\nnot convinced this is a real near -term threat given the ongoing growing value of \\nsports.  \\nValuation\\nWe are maintaining our $33 price target based on a target valuation of ~14.5x our \\nCY2017 EPS esti mate of $2.30. Our multiple reflects the recent re -rating in the \\nMedia sector but is still a premium to FOXA’s current forward valuation, reflecting \\nour expectation that investor sentiment for the name will improve as the company \\ndelivers on expectations. On a sum -of-the-parts basis, we value the shares at $38. We \\ncontinue to see FOXA in a strong content position with a relatively stronger asset \\nmix than many peers, though we acknowledge it has become a bit of a “show me” \\nstory as after several negative est imate revisions, investors may wait to see some \\nexecution before jumping in .\\nRisks to Rating and Price Target\\n\\uf0b7Investment spending may come in higher than anticipated. With the cost of \\nsports programming continuing to rise and increasing competition amon g cable \\nand b roadcast networks, it is possible that investment spending could come in \\nhigher than expected. The company continues to invest in new channel launches \\nand deve lopment (primarily FS1 and FXX). If future investment in content is \\nhigher than we a nticipate, results could fall short of our estimates.\\n\\uf0b7Soft ratings trends at FOX could continue. While we expect some \\nimprovement in ratings given the second season of hit Empire (which returned \\nlast week to a very strong premiere of 16m viewers) and incre ased investment \\nspending on programming at FOX, ratings are unpredictable. Soft viewership \\ntrends could continue at the network, which would weigh on advertising revenues \\nand could necessitate additional investment spending.\\n\\uf0b7Sizable acquisitions outside th e core business may not be well received. The \\ncompany  has a history  of being acquisitive, and we believe sizable acq uisitions \\nnot related to the core business may be viewed negatively by investors. \\nManagement has stated that it has a preference of build vs buy and will be ver y \\ndisciplined on acquisition s,somewhat mitigating this risk ,in our view .

Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated\\nExplanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe: \\nJ.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outpe rform the \\naverage total return of the stock s in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] Neutral [Over the next six to twelve \\nmonths, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analyst’s (or the analys t’s team’s) \\ncoverage universe .] Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of \\nthe stocks in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] Not Rated (NR): J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if \\napplicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy \\nreasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a \\nrecommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex -Australia) and U.K. small -and mid -cap equity research, each stock’s expected total return is \\ncompared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those analysts’ coverage unive rse.

The valuation methodology used by JP Morgan assumes a slight premium to Netflix's valuation per US streaming sub, given Hulu's higher ARPU and growth potential. The implied EV/sales multiple of 3.2x 2017 sales is well below Netflix's US streaming service at 4.0x.
